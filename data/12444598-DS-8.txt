Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results in the operating room at the time of the procedure. POST BYPASS The patient is v paced. There is normal biventricular systolic function. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It appears well seated. The leaflets appear to be moving normally but they are not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is appreciated. The peak and mean gradients through the aortic valve were 22 and 9 mmHg, respectively at a cardiac output of about 5 liters/minute. The effective aortic valve area is about 1.7 cm2. The rest of valvular function is unchanged. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.    I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with ___ regulations.
