Blood culture ___ NGTD

___ NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:   There is no intracranial hemorrhage. A large area of encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe is noted and appears chronic. There is no CT evidence for acute transcortical infarction. Additional scattered white matter hypodensities are noted, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. There are more focal lacunar infarcts in the left and right basal ganglia. Ventricles and sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related parenchymal atrophy. There is no shift of midline structures. There is no hemorrhage or parenchymal edema. There are no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. The basal cisterns are preserved.   There are no fractures. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized and clear with the exception of minimal mucosal thickening in the ethemoid air cells. The extracranial soft tissues, including the globes and orbits, are unremarkable.   IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology, including no evidence for hemorrhage. Large area of left frontal encephalomalacia likely reflects a prior infarct. Additional white matter hypodensity, which likely reflects sequelae of chronic small vessel infarcts, with more focal lacunes identified in the bilateral basal ganglia.   ___ FINDINGS: There is no fracture or traumatic malalignment involving the cervical spine. The atlanto-axial, atlanto-occipital articulations are maintained. There is no significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Vertebral bodies are normal in height. There are moderate degenerative changes identified in the lower cervical spine, worse from C4 through C7, where there is loss of intervertebral disc height, and marginal osteophyte formation, resulting in moderate canal stenosis. There is also moderate neural foraminal narrowing secondary to uncovertebral osteophyte formation and facet hypertrophy. Nuchal ligament calcification is noted.   A nasal trumpet is noted in the left naris, terminating above the epiglottis.  There are carotid calcifications. There is no lymphadenopathy or soft tissue mass in the neck. The right thyroid lobe demonstrates small hypodense nodules, which could be further evaluated with ultrasound as clinically indicated. Visualized lung apices demonstrate no acute pathology. There is a small bleb medially at the left apex.   IMPRESSION: 1. No definite fracture or traumatic malalignment involving the cervical spine. Degenerative changes from C4 through C7 are noted, with associated moderate canal stenosis. If there is concern for cord injury, MRI could be considered for further evaluation, if not contraindication. 2. Tiny hypodense nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid may be further evaluated with ultrasound on a non-emergent basis if indicated. 3. Carotid calcifications. 

___ ekg Compared to the previous tracing normal sinus rhythm has given way to sinus tachycardia, rate 111. Otherwise, there is no significant change. Q waves present from prior

___ eeg: prelim no epileptiform wave

___ CXR  FINDINGS: Single semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. Right lower paratracheal opacity most likely corresponds to vasculature.   IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 

Endoscopy ___: There is blood clot attached at the GE junction with no activate bleeding. Erosions in the stomach body Erosion in the second part of the duodenum There was no coffee-ground liquid or fresh blood in the stomach. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CTA ___: There is satisfactory contrast opacification of the pulmonary artery to subsegmental level with no pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. The caliber of the aorta, pulmonary artery, and heart size is normal with trace pericardial effusion most likely physiological. The central airways are widely patent to subsegmental level. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Marked mediastinal lipomatosis could be due to concurrent steroid therapy.   Mixed atherosclerotic plaque is in the aortic arch and extends to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Calcification is mild in the coronary arteries and aortic valve.   Allowing for the expiratory phase of imaging, the lungs are clear. Pleural surfaces are smooth, no pleural effusion.   This examination was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note an NG tube, which passes into the duodenum. A PICC line tip is in the SVC.   IMPRESSION:   No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.  

MR ___: There is extensive left frontal post-ischemic encephalomalacia with moderate global volume loss. There are linear regions of abnormal decreased diffusion within the centrum semiovale and corona radiata. There is no evidence for recent or prior intracranial hemorrhage. Abnormal flow void is present within the intracranial right internal carotid artery, compatible with its known occlusion. Extensive small vessel changes are present within the pons.   IMPRESSION: 1. Acute/subacute right hemispheric infarct in a pattern suggestive of watershed infarct likely related to the occlusion of the right ICA.   2. Chronic extensive left frontal post-ischemic encephalomalacia.  

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo ___ speaking PMHx HTN, DM2, CVA in ___ with residual deficits and CVA early ___, treated at ___ ___ admitted with fluctuating mental status. .  Patient was initially admitted to the medicine service, course below:

# AMS: Patient improved somewhat during admission however not back to recent baseline where he was eating and walking independently with ___ at rehab. Given recent fluctuating mental status concerning for delirium. Neuro felt exam nonfocal and presentation c/w delirum given UTI and metabolic derangements which seems reasonable especially insetting of UTI and fever. He had a negative head CT for CVA. Patient was r/o for an MI and had unchanged Qwaves in his EKG in right heart distribution. TSH, RPR, B12 within nl and CXR without pna. Most likely MS changes from below infections. Patient was treated for cdiff and UTI as below. . # inability to eat: Patient continued to keep food in his cheeks, swallowing at his own pace, and was unable to follow directions of speech and swallow eval. He had many oral secretions, concerning that he was at high risk of aspiration. Intially family wanted to try food despite this risk, however he failed swallow study multiple times. NGT was placed for TFs and meds on ___ with hope that with nutrition delerium might also improve. . # Klebsiella UTI: pansensitive. Patient had foley on morning after admission which was d/c'd. Finised 7 day course of treatment for UTI with Ceftriaxone on ___. . # cdiff: most likely contributor (over UTI) of leukocytosis and MS ___ on Vancomycin PO. Consider treating for ___fter treatment for UTI finishes (___). . # hypernatremia: improved with free water. . # HTN: uncontrolled on oral meds during admission. Metoprolol was increased and amlodipine was added. . # s/p recent stroke: Per records occured at ___ ___. Now on secondary prevention and in rehab. Continued asa/plavix and added statin. .  # DM2: appears diet control. Was on ISS. .  # CKD: Cr improved at baseline(1.3) after IVF, likely prerenal.   .  # Gout: on colchicine with CKD, was held. .  ***COURSE IN NEURO ICU***

#NEURO: On ___, the medical team examined him at 7am and did not observe a decrease in his baseline speech (does not speak more than a word or phrase at baseline). They did not observe new left arm weakness although they had difficult testing him as he was not following commands at the time. At 10:15am, team observed that patient was not speaking. He was not following any commands. Patient was not moving his left arm. The neurology stroke consult was recalled and evaluated the patient. It was noted that he was moving his left side but his eyes were deviated to the right and he had profound neglect of the left side of his body. He had a CTA and a CTP of the head and neck and there was determined to be ischemia of the right hemisphere, although not frank infarction. He was noted also to have an occulsion of the R ICA in the petrous portion. CT perfusion showed that there was increased mean transit time (indicating decreased flow) in the right ACA and MCA indicating ischemia. Cerebral blood volume was not decreased suggesting that there was not completed infarct in this region. CTA neck and brain showed that the right ICA was occluded from the proximal right ICA to the supraclinoid area. It was not clear when this occlusion had occurred - if it was that day or in prior days. It was discussed with Dr. ___ Neurointerventional ___ regarding whether to attempt opening the right ICA with ___ device and stenting. However, it was felt that the risks outweighed the benefits. Attempting to open the right ICA could result in emboli to the right ACA and MCA which could worsen his situation because his right ACA and MCA vessels were open. The family was informed that the procedure was not offered due to the high risk. 

The patient was started on an heparin drip, and his antihypertensive medications were held. He was started on fluids and transferred to the ICU for monitoring. He was noted to have guaic positive stools at the time but it was felt that this risks of stroke from stump emboli outweighed the risk of the possible GI bleed. In the unit the patient's exam improved, and he was attending to both sides, and intermittently following commands.

On ___ he was noted to have dark tarry stools and some suction from his NGT was frankly bloody. This was accompanied by a drop in HCT. His vitals remained stable througout this course. The heparin drip was stopped, and he was evaluated by GI consult. He was scoped on ___ and was noted to have an ulcer in the GE junction and a duodenal ulcer. The GE junction ulcer was noted to have a blood clot indicating a recent bleed.  He was also noted to have multiple erosions that GI thought were due to NSAID use. They recommended sulcrafate and not to give anti-coagulation. They also recommended not resuming aspirin but plavix would be acceptable in 48-72 hours. The patient Hct remained stable and he was transferred out of the unit on ___.

***NEUROLOGY FLOOR***

##NEURO: Given the need for the ACA and MCA territories to maintain flow from collateral vessels, the patient's blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate up to 180 systolic. The patient was started on plavix on ___ for stroke prevention, and aspirin and coumadin were held per the GI consult team recommendations. The patient's exam remained notable for inattention to the left, minimal volitional use of his left upper extremity, and minimal response to commands, following commands intermittently but only ever simple commands such as open your mouth or wiggle your fingers. He also remained mute and unable to manipulate his tongue for swallowing. Given the lack of improvement in these areas despite no clear infarction on his CT perfusion studies, on ___ he underwent a brain MRI to ascertain if there had been any further infarcts. Indeed, there were areas of subacute/acute watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.  The likely explanation for worsened speech and oral manipulation was thought to be due to a combination of remapping of language after his first left hemispheric stroke and bilateral loss of deeper hemispheric tissue which controls swallowing. Given his multiple infarcts, it was discussed with the family that the patient was unlikely to be able to improve greatly due to progressive infarctions. After multiple family meetings discussing goals of care with the palliative care team facilitating, the family felt that it was appropriate to place a PEG tube. They understood that he might never be able to walk, talk, or live outside of a nursing facility, and they will continue to revisit the goals of care as they assess his improvement.

##GI Bleed: The patient's hematocrit was followed closely while he was on the floor and remained stable in the ___ range.  Given this stability, frequency was decreased to daily checks on ___. The patient's sucralfate was noted to be clogging his NG tube, thus the medication was discontinued after discussion with GI consult on ___. GI felt that despite his ulcer it was safe to proceed with PEG placement, and they have been consulted regarding this placement. The PEG was placed on ___ and tube feeds were started the next day. His H/H has remained stable with Hct of 30 the last few days.

##UTI: The patient completed his antibiotic course for UTI that had been started on the medicine service on ___. A repeat UA was sent on ___ just to assess off of antibiotics given that the patient seemed slightly less interactive and was normal.

##C dif: The patient was briefly NPO after the NG tube became clogged, and during that time he was given flagyl IV as there was no evidence seen that he had initially failed flagyl, however once the NG was replaced he was started back on oral vancomycin to be completed on ___ (10 days after completing UTI therapy).

##DEPRESSION: The patient's affect seemed to become flatter and he appeared less interactive from ___. This was may have related to his new strokes, however, he was started on a trial of celexa on ___ given that the decision had been made to continue aggressive therapy.

##GU: the patient had a foley removed. His input and output should be watched and if urine output drops a bladder scan should be performed and consider a straight catheterization
