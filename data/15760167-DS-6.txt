A KUB showed multiple air-fluid levels concerning for obstruction.The patient was designated NPO with IV fluids and an NGT. An NG tube was noted to drain variable amounts of bilious liquid. No gas or solid stool was observed in the patient's ostomy bag over several days. Given further concern for progression of SBO, patient received an abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast on hospital day 2, which was notable for a high grade SBO with transition point within a parastomal hernia previously seen on exam. Patient was taken to the OR on ___ for a herniorrhapy with mesh fixation, which relieved the SBO. The procedure went well without complications. Please refer to the Operative Note for details. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and scheduled tylenol and iv dilaudid for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: No active issues were encountered during this hospitalization. Patient received standing doses of acetaminophen and dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain, both pre-operatively and post-operatively. Cardio: Given significant cardiac history, including atrial fibrillation, patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospitalization. On postoperative day 1, patient was noted to have several beats of tachycardia and an EKG concerning for afib with RVR. Patient was started on amiodarone 200mg and given magnesium 4mg to provide further cardiac stabilization. On postoperative day 2, the patient was taken off of PO medications because of abdominal distension and being made NPO. Patient was given metoprolol and hydralazine prn for blood pressure control. An EKG showed unchanged LBBB with unspecific ST changes. Serial cardiac enzymes were unrevealing. Prior to discharge patient was restarted on his home medications including his home dose of warfarin with instructions to continue having his coumadin monitored outpatient. GI/FEN: On the operative day semi solid brown stool was visible within the ostomy bag. Patient was advanced to sips the same day, tolerating the sips. On postoperative day 1 the NGT was removed and patient was advanced to a regular diet. Patient was taking minimal po intake due to decreased appetite. Given that his ostomy was producing 1.6 L of loose fecal material and his abdomen appeared more distended with complaints of nausea, patient was placed back on NPO with IVF. An NGT was reinserted producing 1 L of bilious output. On postoperative day 2 the ostomy was forming thicker bowel with increased gas production. Electrolytes were routinely monitored and replaced as needed.Over the next few days the patient continued to produce gas through his ostomy along with thicker bowel movements. Abdomen appeared less distended. Patient was tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge. GU: A foley catheter to gravity was placed intraoperatively to monitor fluid status and renal perfusion. Catheter was removed on POD #1 and patient maintained ability to evacuate urine without issue. Endo: Patient was given IV levothyroxine prior to his ability to tolerate PO.He was transitioned to PO levothyroxine when tolerating oral food. He was started on sliding scale insuling and blood sugars were routinely monitored. ID: Patient was afebrile during this hospitalization. On day of discharge some oral thrush was noticed and patient was discharged with oral nystatin with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician if this failed to resolve. PPX: Given the potential early in the course of the hospitalization for surgical management, patient was initially anticoagulated with Heparin 5000U TID. He was also given IV pantaprazole as GERD prophylaxis.Patient was restarted on coumadin when tolerating PO intake and was discharged on his home regimen.
