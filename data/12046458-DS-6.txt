 Name: ___           Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Seffin / ceftriaxone / Cephalosporins  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: colon cancer

 Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ CVL placement  History of Present Illness: ___ with history of moderate-severe AS (valve area 1), CHF (EF 25%), atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, ___ cirrhosis (+varices, no ascites), COPD, AIHA, and colon adenocarcinoma who presented today for open right colectomy, and is transferred to ___ for post-operative shock.

Mr. ___ was diagnosed with colon cancer after 70 pound weight loss over course of ___ yr, with heme-positive stool. A CT was performed showing cecal thickening, which ultimately led to colonoscopy ___ that showed a long segment infiltrated ill defined hepatic flexure/ascending colonic mass that was biopsied and 2 tattooed at ___. Pathology revealed invasive adenocarcinoma. He also underwent an MRI for question of liver lesions that was benign. He had been planned for right colectomy at ___ but the case was cancelled due to concern for high perioperative risk.

He was evaluated preoperatively by Dr. ___ felt his AS, though significant, did not preclude surgery. He was asymptomatic from perspective of AS and his heart failure. 

Of note, pt has baseline hypotension and is on midodrine at home for this issue. He had undergone a bowel prep for the surgery.

This morning, his BP in holding area prior to case was 81/54. An open right colectomy was performed. During the case, pt received 2.3L IVF and 250 of albumin and required levophed and phenylephrine throughout the case. His EBL was 400cc during the case and post-op Hct was 29. Urine output was 250-300. He respiratory status was not a problem during the operation and he was on CMV 40% FiO2 with excellent oxygenation.

On arrival to the ___, pt was able to respond appropriately to questions by nodding or shaking his head, and responded to commands. Vitals on arrival: 97.5 76 100/45 on phenylephrine 3, levophed 0.35, 17, 100% on PS 5. CVL placed in RIJ.

 Past Medical History: - Aortic stenosis (Valve area 1cm) - A.fib on rivaroxaban - NASH with evidence of portal hypertension (including splenomegaly, abdominal varices) and thrombocytopenia, suggestive of cirrhosis. No history of variceal bleed or ascites. - ___ with EF ___ - COPD not on home o2 - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia on chronic prednisone 5mg daily. - Right sided colon cancer

 Social History: ___ Family History: Father died at ___ due to alcohol abuse. Mother died at ___ due to crohns disease. No early CAD or sudden cardiac death.

The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to global hypokinesis with relative preservation of basal segment contractile function. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ a pericardial effusion is no longer seen; other findings are similar. 

___ CXR Large pneumoperitoneum reflects recent surgery. Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed and mild pulmonary edema is new.  Endotracheal tube is close to the carina and should be withdrawn at least 3 cm. Nasogastric drainage tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced at least 10 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Small bilateral pleural effusions arepresumed. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium. ============== MICROBIOLOGY ==============

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of moderate-severe AS (valve area 1), CHF (EF 25%), atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, NASH cirrhosis (+varices, no ascites), COPD, AIHA, and colon adenocarcinoma who presented today for open right colectomy, and was transferred to ___ for post-operative shock. There he was co-managed with the surgical team. He was hemodynamically stabilized with fluid management, corticosteroids and pressor agents. He became oliguric and developed marked pulmonary edema and required intubation for hypoxic respirtaory failure. Cardiology was consulted at this point and he was over 20L positive. He was brought emergently to the cardiac cath lab for a right heart cath and possible mechanical support. His cardiac index on high dose dobutamine was borderline. It was deteremined at that time that he had a significant pressure difference between central aortic pressure and radial arterial line pressure due to peripheral vascular disease. Attempt was made to place an Impella but this could not be advanced through the PVD in the aortoiliac vessels. Vascular surgery assisted in perclosure of the arteriotomy site. An IABP was placed. His hemodynamics remained consistent with disrtibutive shock. CVVHD was started but fluid could not be removed because of marked hypotension. In the context of suspected distributive shock from presumed infection (may have been gut ischemia from poor output and ultiamtely anastamotic leak), but also progressive pump failure from volume overload we could not improve perfusion. Off of the IABP he had minimal cardiac output. As he became progressively unstable We discussed with surgical team and there was no option for surgical intervention at that time. We discussed with the family and they came in ___ the decision was made by his family for the patient to become comfort-measures only. On ___, the patient's time of death was 1550.
