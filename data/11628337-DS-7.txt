Imaging ======== ECG ___ Normal sinus rhythm. Borderline voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no significant change.  Read ___. Intervals Axes RatePRQRSQTQTc (___) ___ ___

CXR ___ FINDINGS: There is pulmonary vascular engorgement, with mild pulmonary edema. Note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The heart is enlarged, which appears increased from the prior. No pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.

TTE ___ The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild right ventricular cavity dilation with preserved free wall motion. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global systolic function. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Increased PCWP. Very small circumferential pericardial effusion. 

The right ventricular cavity dilation with pulmonary artery systolic hypertension raises the possibility of a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, COPD, OSA, etc. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has mild aortic valve stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ years.

Likely precipitated by worsening kidney failure and hypertensive urgency. Repeat TTE revealed preserved EF with R ventricular dilatation, mild AS, increased wedge and moderate pulmonary HTN. Patient initially required ___ NC, but was weaned off oxygen with diuresis. She was diuresed to euvolemia with Lasix bolus/drip with Metolazone. Creatinine steadily rose in the setting of diuresis and was 7.3 at discharge, so decision was made to discharge patient on gentle diuresis, to attempt to maintain euvolemia, but not worsen kidney function. Patient's Metoprolol XL was discontinued and replaced with Labetalol for improved blood pressure control. Patient discharged on Labetalol and Torsemide 20mg every other day with close Cardiology follow up. 

# Acute on chronic Kidney Disease: Stage 5 CKD, has fistula in place, but has not yet initiated dialysis. Creatinine had been steadily rising since early this year and was 5.2 on admission. Possible component of cardio-renal, as patient is in acute heart failure. Renal was consulted, but recommended attempting to diurese patient before initiating conversation about dialysis. Patient diuresed well with IV Lasix bolus/drip and Metolazone, but Creatinine continued to rise, peaking at 7.4. Patient continued on home sodium bicarbonate and calcitriol and was started on Sevelamer TID with meals for rising phosphorus. After extensive discussion with patient's PCP, outpatient renal provider and inpatient renal team, decision was made not to initiate dialysis. Patient continued to put out urine throughout admission and showed no signs of uremia. Electrolytes remained within normal limits. Patient's Creatinine was 7.3 at discharge. She will have repeat labs within one week and extremely close outpatient renal follow up.   #Hypertensive Urgency: Patient's blood pressures in 190-200 systolic on admission, despite home medications. Per patient records, she has history of labile blood pressures. Patient was continued on home Amlodipine, but Metoprolol XL was discontinued and she was started on Labetalol 200mg TID. Patient's blood pressures improved significantly and remained within target range throughout admission. Patient discharged on Amlodipine and Labetalol with close PCP and ___ follow up. 

# Elevated troponins: Likely Type II NSTEMI in setting of acute heart failure, worsening CKD. Patient had no ischemic changes by EKG. She complained of some intermittent atypical chest pain, so outpatient cardiologist may consider nuclear stress imaging. Patient's troponins remained stable at 0.06.

# Anemia: Patient's Hb 8.4 on admission, which is close to baseline. Anemia likely secondary to CKD. On PO iron supplementation and Aranesp as outpatient. Iron supplementation continued while inpatient. Patient's hemoglobin remained stable.

Decision was made not to begin dialysis, per discussion with patient, patient's PCP and outpatient nephrologist. She will be followed very closely by Dr. ___ as outpatient. -Patient should have labs drawn for CHEM 10 on ___ to check Creatinine and electrolytes. -Patient should follow a low sodium, low potassium and low phosphorus diet. She was educated about this diet and provided with reading material upon discharge. -Patient has new diagnosis of mild aortic stenosis.
