 History of Present Illness: History is gathered principally from her daughter, who is at bedside and visualized the whole event.

Mrs. ___ awoke this morning feeling well. She was up at approximately 7 in the morning. At 825, she was sitting in her chair at her kitchen table when her daughter walked in. 

When she attempted to speak to her daughter, the words came out slurred and difficult to understand.Her daughter walked over, and noticed a striking right facial droop. Ms. ___ was speaking, and understandable. Language was appropriate.  Concerned, her daughter did a basic stroke assessment. Mrs. ___ was unable to raise her right arm, could not squeeze with her right hand, when she smiled her right lower face did not smile. During this time, Ms. ___ was surprisingly unconcerned with her symptoms, particularly that she could not move her right arm. In fact she asked to finish her cereal (a bowl of Bran).

Understandably concerned, her daughter activated her life alert bracelet. Assisted-living staff responded, and EMS was subsequently called. Her vitals at her facility, reportedly notable for a blood pressure in the 220s. Of note, all of her symptoms resolved within ___ minutes of witnessed onset. Ms. ___ was subsequently brought to our ED at her baseline. 

In our ED, approximately 1145 (perhaps 40 minutes after initial evaluation), she had recurrent right facial droop. Symptoms resolved spontaneously.

CTA head and neck ___ IMPRESSION:   No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Medial temporal atrophy. No acute stenosis or occlusion of the head and neck vessels.  Probable small infundibulum at the origin of the left PCA without appreciable aneurysm.   CT head ___ No read at time of discharge

 Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ is a ___ right handed woman with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and scoliosis, who presented with right facial droop and right arm plegia, subsequently waxing and waning symptoms. Her CTA head and neck on admission was negative for acute intracranial abnormality. CT head the following day was also negative for acute intra-cranial abnormality. Unfortunately, her pacemaker was incompatible with MRI and thus MRI brain was not performed. Her symptoms resolved the following day and she did not have any further events. Etiology is likely a small vessel lacune, especially since she had a "stuttering" clinical course. On exam at the time of discharge she had slight pronation of her right hand, but otherwise was back to baseline. Likely she had a small lacunar infarct that was not visible on ___. LDL was 83, and A1C was 5.1%. She was started on ASA 81 mg daily for secondary stroke prevention. She has follow up scheduled with neurology. She was evaluated by ___ who recommended outpatient ___.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear ___,

___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided weakness, likely resulting from an acute ischemic stroke - a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Your symptoms improved substantially so it is likely your stroke is very small, though we were unable to confirm this with a brain MRI because of your pacemaker.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke: - high cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows: STARTED aspirin 81 mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below.

If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to ___ - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team
