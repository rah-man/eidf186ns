Stool studies: pending  Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F with CAD s/p PCI with stent x 2, CHF with EF 35%, IDDM, HTN and recent infectious colitis in ___ who is admitted after syncopal event in the setting of hypotension with subsequent abdominal pain and diarrhea. . Patient presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea after hypotensive episode consistent with ischemic colitis. Patient was hydrated with iv fluids cautiously given her ejection fraction of 35%. Her lasix was held to prevent further hypovolemia. Stool studies were negative. She was started empirically on ciprofloxacin and flagyl to cover a possible infectious colitis. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained which was a limited study due to the lack of contrast and showed wall thickening/stranding at the colosigmoid junction supporting a diagnosis of colitis (infectious vs ischemic).  Patient requested that she be treated conservatively and declined further work-up including MRA and colonoscopy. She will complete a 1-week course of empiric antibiotics as an outpt. . Patient's syncopal event was thought to be due to hypotension and orthostasis when standing from seated position. Etiology of her hypotension was likely profound dehydration in the setting of decreased po intake and excessive heat outside. Hypotension resolved quickly with iv hydration in the emergency department.  Patient had no symptoms to suggest sepsis as the etiology of hypotension. She was monitored on telemetry without any events and serial biomarkers were negative x 3.  . Patient has chronic systolic CHF with EF of 35% with known CAD.  She was continued on her ___ and ___. Patient's beta blocker was initially held due to hypotension but later restarted and titrated up to her home dose of 300mg daily. Her Lisinopril was held due to ___. Given that her ___ had just recovered, this was held even at the time of discharge. If her Cr remains stable at f/u, her ACE-I can be restarted at that time. Patient was told to restart Norvasc 15 if BP persistently elevated prior to f/u appt with PMD. Discharge Lasix dose was 40mg daily, as opposed to prior dose of 80mg daily, given the insult of hypotension and volume depletion on her bowels and kidneys. . Patient has insulin dependent diabetes and her Lantus was held initially due to diarrhea and poor po intake. She was told to restart Lantus at 10U QAM. This will likely need to be titrated as an outpt, as her previous dose was 30U. This Her fingersticks were elevated during the admission, which was treated with sliding scale Insulin. . Patient had acute on chronic kidney disease stage III, which was attibuted to volume depletion. This normalized from 2.2 to 1.3 as diarrhea decreased and po intake improved.  She was evaluated by ___, who sent her home with a cane. They recommended home ___, but pt adamantly declined, despite extensive discussion regarding her safety. She understood the risks, with daughter and husband at the bedside, and insisted on refusing services.
