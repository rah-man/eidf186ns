 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o gentleman with a history of CAD, infarct related cardiomyopathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes who presents to the CCU after right heart catheterization procedure/PA cath placement for trial of inotropes/tailored therapy. . >> ACTIVE ISSUES: # Heart failure with depressed EF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy Pt presented to the hospital as a planned admission on ___ for a right heart catherization and trial of inotropes. PA catheter was also placed on ___ for monitoring of cardiac indices while inotropic therapy was started. Cardiac Index measured during the RHC was 1.8 with a cardiac output of 3.98 L/min. The patient was brought to the CCU after the catheterization procedure where milrinone 0.26-0.5mcg/kg/min IV was started with plans to titrate to a cardiac index of 2.0.  Pacemaker interrogation was also done on ___ with results shown above. Patient was restarted on his home meds with the exception of metoprolol which had been held 1 week prior due to fatigue. On ___, Mr. ___ was given an additional dose of torsemide 40mg (total 80mg) due to inadequate diuresis. His cardiac index ranged between 2.0 and 2.1 on milrinone 0.5mcg/kg/min IV and he seemed to be tolerating therapy well. Later in the day, due to continued difficulty with diuresis, Mr. ___ was given ___ 120mg IV bolus and subsequently started on Lasix 10mg/hr continuous drip. Over the next ___ hours, he put out 1,325mL with 716mL intake. On ___, Mr. ___ continued to do well with CI 2.4 and CO 5.2L. He also received a PICC line for anticipation of home inotropic therapy. Titration of his diuresis was done in accordance to PCWP pressure goals of ___. Once goal pressures met, PA cath was discontinued and patient it was attempted to keep patient in fluid balance. Home infusion care with milrinone was done prior to discharge, with PICC line teaching and infusion teaching at bedside with patient and his family. After an episode of symptomatic VT (which self terminated) on ___ patient expressed a desire to minimize arrhythmia symptoms, so the decision was made to discontinue milrinone and to be sent home that day on amiodarone. Education regarding dietary medication compliance continued.

# CAD s/p infarction and PCI/CABG x4 Mr. ___ was maintained on his home medications of aspirin 81mg PO daily, atorvastatin 80mg PO daily, nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL PRN chest pain, and fenofibrate 145mg PO daily for the duration of the hospital stay. At no point did he complain of any chest pain or discomfort. Admission EKG did not show any new ST segment changes or T wave abnormalities. 

# Status post ___ ICD (___) with CRT optimization ___ Mr. ___ pacemaker was interrogated during this admission with the results shown above. While on milrinone therapy, he experienced frequent VPBs as seen on telemetry. Goals of care discussion with the patient and his family was done during admission, and was noted that he will go home on milrinone with his ICD sensing turned off. On the AM of ___ - patient underwent a short episode of sustained VT which produced lightheadedness and vision changes. VT self terminated and did not require external intervention. However, the episode was distressing, and Mr ___ initially expressed a desire to turn ICD back on. After a family meeting, however, it was decided to keep his ICD off, continue DNR/DNI and to withdraw his milrinone which was thought to be contributing to his arrhytmia/ectopy. He was discharged on seven days of amiodarone for arrhytmia suppression during the milrinone washout period. . >> CHRONIC ISSUES: # Pre-diabetes: During this hospital admission, Mr. ___ blood glucose ranged from 98 to 184. He was maintained on a regular diet, 2g sodium, heart healthy. His most recent HbA1c is from ___ and was 5.9.  . # BPH: Mr. ___ was maintained on his home medications of finasteride 5mg PO daily and tamsulosin 0.4mg PO QHS. He did not complain of urinary frequency, urgency, or hesitation during this admission. . # Depression: Mr. ___ was maintained on his home medication of venlafaxine XR 225mg PO daily. He did experience brief episodes of depressed mood where he expressed the desire to leave the hospital with wishes that "if he was going to die, he did not want to die in a hospital." His mood usually improved after a few hours and he was compliant with the CCU team's plan. . # Hypothyroidism: Mr. ___ was maintained on his home medication of levothyroxine sodium 137mcg PO daily. His most recent TSH was 6.5 on ___. . # Gout: Mr. ___ was maintained on his home medications of allopurinol ___ PO daily and indomethacin 50mg PO QID PRN gouty attacks. He did not experience any gout symptoms during this admission. . >> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Ischemic CM, decompenstaed sCHF: Patient to continue home torsemide dose for maitnenace diuresis. He is to continue to monitor weights and low sodium diet. # ___ PPM/ICD: Patient had ICD turned OFF during admission in alliance with goals of care discussion during hospital stay with patient and patient's family. # VT: Patient elected to have withdrawal of milrinone prior to discharge, as it was contributing to his ectopy. # Code Status: Patient has elected to continue DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ ___. You were admitted after a right heart catheterization showed elevated pressures in your heart. You were started on a new medication, milrinone, to help with your symptoms. These medications will not be continued once you leave the hospital, but you will be started on a medication to suppress abnormal heart rhythms. It is very important to limit your fluid intake to less than 2 liters per day to prevent fluid build up. You should also limit your salt intake to less than 2g per day. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. We are glad you are feeling better and we wish you well.
