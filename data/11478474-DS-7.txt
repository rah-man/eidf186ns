LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation. 

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Aortic valve not well seen. Minimal AS. Trace AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate (___) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. No PS. Physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views. Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Left pleural effusion. 

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION: 

         N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic  Conclusions  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokensis of the basal inferior and the distal half of the suptum and apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Minimal aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary hypertension. No significant pericardial effsusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, regional left ventricular dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia/infarction. The severity of mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and PA systolic hypertension are now higher.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The ___ has mild aortic valve stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ years. Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.   Electronically signed by ___, MD, Interpreting physician ___ ___ 10:56
