Microbiology ___ BCX Negative

Imaging ___ CXR A right-sided tunneled dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. The patient is post-median sternotomy. The heart size is top normal. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema. Mild bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible with atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from this examination, but no large effusion is seen. IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ACUTE CARE 1. Hypotension - Most likely secondary to excessive ultrafiltration at HD today. Has now resolved after 1L NS. Pt. appears to be euvolemic on exam. Potential other causes of his hypotension include cardiac dysfunction, given his h/o CHF. This seems less likely given his history, exam, and CXR. Cardiac enzymes not c/w acute ischemia with troponin 0.04 in setting of renal disease and this is around baseline per our records. His CKMB was flat. Other potential etiology is bacteremia, with his major risk factor being dialysis access, so blood cultures were obtained and were pending at time of discharge. Assessed adrenal insufficiency by checking random cortisol level, which was normal.

2. Anemia - Hct is at his baseline. This is likely his anemia of chronic disease. Consider increasing his epogen by 50% during dialysis sessions.

CHRONIC CARE

3. AFIB - cont home amiodarone. The aptient is not taking warfarin, confirmed with his niece and the patient. This was reportedly discontinued due to bleeding complications.

4. CAD - cont home simvastatin

5. DEPRESSION - cont home mirtazapine, zolpidem, citalopram

6. ESRD - cont home sevelamer, cont home cinacalcet. ___ long standing htn.

7. GERD - Cont home pantoprazole.

8. Back Pain - cont home lidocaine patch, gabapentin. He is also on percocet.

9. Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-500mg 1 TAB PO Q6H:PRN pain 

10. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine.
