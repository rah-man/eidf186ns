At subsequent dialysis session the graft was no longer functional. Ultrasound showed occlusive thrombus throughout right upper extremity graft. Concern for overlying cellulitis and patient received IV vancomycin in the ED. However, on exam she was afebrile and it was thought that erythema/swellling was most likely secondary to the thrombosis and so antibiotics were discontinued. She had a successful thrombectomy on ___, after which the graft was accessed during dialysis. 

# Hyperkalemia: Initially elevated to 6.1, normalized with D50/insulin and calcium gluconate. Secondary to missed HD due to clotted graft. Hyperkalemia resolved following dialysis after thrombectomy.

# ESRD: On HD MWF, sevelamer TID was continued. Dialysis was also continued following thrombectomy. She received both ___ and ___ HD due to missed session on ___, now back on regular ___ schedule.

# CAD: aspirin 81 and atorvastatin were continued. Warfarin was held due to planned cardiac catheterization on ___.

# DMII: Insulin sliding scale. Repaglinide was held. 

# Hypertension: lisinopril, metoprolol, imdur were continued.  # Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 3 (HTN, CHF, DM2), on amiodarone and warfarin. Warfarin was held on ___ and ___ for cardiac cath on ___ and she also received one dose of vitamin K. Given IVC filter, she did not require heparin bridging (also takes warfarin for recurrent DVT prophylaxis).  # Chronic Diastolic CHF: EF 50-55%, exam with mild pulmonary edema but patient comfortable and satting well on RA. Lasix 40mg daily was continued

Transitional Issues: - warfarin should be resumed following cardiac catheterization - also will likely require removal of IVC filter following cardiac catheterization  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Amiodarone 200 mg PO DAILY 2. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 3. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY 4. Lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY 5. Warfarin 2 mg PO DAILY 6. Repaglinide 0.5 mg PO DAILY 7.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Thrombosis of RUE graft 

 Discharge Condition: Mental status: alert and appropriate Ambulatory status: independent (uses cane)

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to the hospital with redness and swelling of your dialysis fistula which was ultimately found to be due to a clot in the graft. On ___ the clot was treated with a procedure called thrombectomy and your graft returned to normal functioning (allowing you to go to dialysis as usual on ___ and ___.  You are coincidentally scheduled for a cardiac catheterization tomorrow, ___, to put a stent in your left main coronary artery (i.e. to unblock the main vessel that feeds the heart). In order to lower the risk of bleeding with this procedure, we have stopped your warfarin (coumadin) to lower the INR (coumadin level). You should take your regular medications tonight, but do not take any medications for diabetes. You can eat breakfast prior to 6:30am tomorrow morning but should not eat anything after that. Please arrive at 10:30am for your cardiac catherization.  The procedure will take place here on the ___ campus; enter through the ___ entrance, turn left, and take the ___ elevators to the cath lab on the ___ floor where they will check you in. You will stay overnight in the hospital after your procedure tomorrow. Please follow up with your cardiologist and primary care doctor within ___ week of leaving the hospital.   Followup Instructions: ___
