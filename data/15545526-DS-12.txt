PNA vs. other process found to have a positive AFB smear from ___, who presented to clinic ___ with fever and SOB, s/p ICU transfer for Afib with RVR improved with Dilt/metoprolol, now hemodynamically stable in NSR sputum +klebsiella.

#Afib with RVR: Transferred to ICU on ___ for this, now converted to sinus and hemodynamically stable since then. Cardiology following. TTE with no evidence of pericardial effusion. Resumed home metoprolol with holding parameters.

#Fever/SOB: Recent admission with chest CT ___ showing LL predominant multifocal consolidations c/f multifocal infection v. vasculitis v. COPD v. pulmonary infarcts. He was treated for HCAP. Sputum sample ___ grew AFB, repeat samples neg now off TB precautions. Beta glucan level also highly elevated on ___. However, most recent B-glucan is negative without a clear therapy. Has had ongoing intermittent productive cough. CT chest ___ shows rapid progression of pulmonary infection. He is growing klebsiella on his sputum cultures which could certainly account for his interval change on imaging and it appears to have been somewhat high grade as is on three different cultures despite therapy. Per pulmonary recs, should obtain chest CT 2 weeks after treatment for klebsiella to evaluate for possible secondary infectious process. If no improvement or significant residual disease per imaging, bronchoscopy would then be indicated. Pulmonary also recommended evaluation for aspiration risk given distribution of disease but this may be difficult to obtain due to TB precautions. -crypto antigen in blood and urine histo negative -ceftazidime (___) then changed to ceftriaxone to complete 14d course ___, off ___ and vanco since ___ -appreciate ID recs-see note AFB unlikely at this point, negative sputums x3 -repeat CT chest 2 weeks after most recent -weekly fungal markers -IgG level 796 on ___

#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: BNP on admission was elevated at 4800 and patient was mildly volume overloaded on exam the afternoon of ___, resumed home lasix. CXR ___ shows mild pulmonary edema; however, repeat ___ in the setting of worsening SOB showed progressive pulmonary edema w/ bilateral effusions. Continues on home regimen of lasix 40mg BID and baseline crackles at b/l bases. -Lasix IV x 1 on ___, consider repeat dose if no improvement -telemetry for continuous 02 monitoring -monitoring strict I/Os

#Coagulopathy: Likely vit K deficient, received PO vitamin K. Low suspicion for inhibitor but we checked a mixing study since if he did have an inhibitor with worsened hemoptysis treatment would be different. -vitamin K 5mg x 1 on ___ and ___ -f/u mixing study -restarted prophylactic heparin daily dosing and when checking PTT, this should be done peripherally (not from his port)

#HR MDS: He has been maintained on dacogen for about a year now, currently on C14 so holding now in the setting of active infection. Exjade on hold while inpatient. -transfuse to maintain hgb > 7, -will need Lasix prn with transfusions

#Acute on chronic kidney disease: CKD stage III attributed to HTN and vascular disease. Cr slightly above baseline of 1.4-1.6 though downtrending since admission. Possibly in the setting of volume overload.  -Lasix as above  -Trend Cr  -Avoid nephrotoxins  -Hold lisinopril

#Hernia: Etiology likely due to previous abdominal surgery in ___ ? incisional-related. No abdominal discomfort or tenderness. We will continue to monitor closely 

#HTN:  -Continue metoprolol with holding parameters -Hold lisinopril given acute on chronic renal failure   #CAD: Continue ASA 81
