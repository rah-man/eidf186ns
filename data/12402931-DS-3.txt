 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with past medical history of hypothyroidism as well as recent diagnosis of myasthenia ___ (currently followed by Dr. ___ and on prednisone 60 and imuran 100mg BID) who presents for recurrent fevers of unknown origin. He is without respiratory symptoms or weakness and his neurological exam is nonfocal. He is admitted for further workup of the source of his fever.

PLAN: - LP with fluoroscopy showed only 1 WBC, no signs of infection and empiric coverage with acyclovir that was started in the Emergency Room was discontinued - OSH records from Dr. ___ reviewed: tick-borne workup from earlier this week showed Anaplasmosis, Lyme, Erlichia all negative - per ID recs: we resent urine histoplasma,serum/CSF crypto antigen, Lyme, Anaplasma, Erlichia, mycolytic Bcx. These can be followed up as outpatient - f/u CSF studies- Herpes Simplex Virus PCR; Acid Fast (TB) Culture; Cryptococcal Antigen; Fungal culture; Viral culture - routine; Borrelia burgdorferi Antibody Index for CNS Infection; Varicella-Zoster Virus DNA, PCR are pending, but given his lack of symptoms and the low likelihood of disseminated neurologic infection we did not feel it was necessary to keep the patient inpatient while results pend. The studies can be followed up as outpatient at his next clinic appointment. We can fax records to his ID physician once an appointment is made. - NIFs and vital capacity remained normal -Myasthenia medications: continue home doses of prednisone, mestinon and imuran. He will be seen in clinic next month by Dr. ___
