She underwent TEE (without thrombus) and cardioversion, and remained in NSR post procedure. She was in good condition and discharged home on flecainide, metoprolol and rivaroxaban. 

Afib with RVR ============================== She was initially seen at a OSH and treated with rate control and heparin gtt anticoagulation and transferred to ___ for possible cardioversion. This was new onset afib without any history of arrhythmias in the past. Patient underwent cardiac catheterization at OSH with no obstructing CAD. Patient had been taking coumadin as outpatient however was started on the heparin gtt at OSH for subtherapeutic INR. TSH was 1.9 which ruled out hyperthyroidism as a cause. She was continued initially on metoprolol and heparin gtt and underwent TEE with successful cardioversion. Following cardioversion she remained in sinus rhythm. She was started on flecainide and rivaroxaban. Metoprolol dose was titrated down to 25mg succinate daily to avoid bradycardia. She remained chest pain free, without palpitations or SOB following the procedure. She was discharged in good condition. 

Transitional Issues ============================= 1. Follow up appointments were made with patient's primary care physiscian Dr. ___ on ___. Follow up appointment will be made with Dr. ___ in cardiology for 1 month from now.

Patient was started on flecainide 100mg BID and rivaroxaban 20mg daily to continue as an outpatient. 3. Patients home metoprolol dose was changed to 25mg succinate daily. 4. Home lasix was restarted however patient did not have signs of obvious fluid overload. The need for continued lasix should be discussed with Dr. ___ at her appointment on ___.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for a heart electrical conduction problem called atrial fibrillation. You were initially treated for this problem with a medication called metoprolol, however it was not well controlled and still caused you to be short of breath. For this reason, we did a procedure called cardioversion to restore your heart to beating in a normal rhythm. Prior to the procedure, we did an ultrasound of your heart called a transesophageal echocardiogram or TEE to make sure you did not have any blood clots in your heart. The procedure was successful and you did not have any problems afterwards. We started you on a medication called flecainide to help keep your heart beating in a normal rhythm and a medication called rivaroxaban to help prevent any blood clots from forming. This will replace the coumadin you were taking, and you no longer need to have your INR levels checked regularly. Your metoprolol dose was adjusted to 25mg daily. It is important to follow up with your cardiologist to ensure your heart stays in a normal rhythm and you do not have any assitional problems. It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Best of luck, Your ___ medical team  Followup Instructions: ___
