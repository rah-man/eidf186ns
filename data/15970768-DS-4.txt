___ EKG: NSR no ST changes

Imaging: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  There is a new area of hypodensity in the left posterior temporal region compared to the CT from ___, with sulcal effacement, cytotoxic edema, and loss of grey-white matter differentiation, findings compatible with acute to subacute watershed infarct.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. Prominent ventricles and sulci suggests age-related atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The basal cisterns appear patent.   No fracture is identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. The globes are unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with an acute to subacute watershed infarct within the left posterior temporal region. 

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of ___ IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved from the prior study. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a left pleural effusion and an area of newly appeared left parenchymal consolidation in the retrocardiac and left basal lung areas. In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia with an associated pleural effusion might be the most likely differential diagnosis. At the time of dictation and observation, the referring physician, ___, was paged for notification. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal-appearing right lung. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the severity and extent of the pre-existing left lower lung opacity has minimally decreased. However, the opacity is overall still massive. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. The right lung is unchanged and normal. 

Pending studies: ___ Neurophysiology EEG Pending ___ Neurophysiology EEG Pending  Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F with PMH Alzheimer's dementia presenting with cc of altered mental status found to have a recent stroke, urinary tract infection, and seizures. Hospital course was complicated by HCAP, delirium, and recurrent aspirations.

# Altered mental status: Patient presented with 2 week change in mental status including personality changes with more withdrawn appearance upon baseline advanced dementia, increased speech difficulties, and mild facial weakness of R side. She also had an episode of possible seizure that was treated with 0.5mg ativan. A CT showed evidence of a subacute stroke that is new from ___. She also had a urinary tract infection.  Medication side effect from lorazepam also may have been contributing, as elderly patients are very sensitive to benzodiazepines. Seizure may also be contributing to altered mental status.

# Stroke: Patient presented with 2 week history of altered mental status and R facial assymetry. On exam she was also noted to have a fixed and dilated Left pupil. CT showed a hypodensity in left posterior temporal-occiptial region concerning for acute infarct, new from ___. Patient seen and evaluated by neurology who felt this was a subacute stroke, likely dating back to onset of R facial droop about ___ weeks ago. Patient continued on aspirin 81 mg until difficulty swallowing and switched to 150 mg PR.

# Urinary tract infection: Leukocytosis and positive UA on admission with lactate of 1.3 and no fevers. Urine culture done at ___ showed Proteus Mirabilis sensitive to ceftriaxone. Patient treated with 4 days of ceftriaxone in house and switched to cefepime for dual treatment of HCAP and urine culture growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

# Seizure: Patient presented from skilled nursing facility with episode concerning for seizure, with limb shaking/trembling and decreased level of responsivenes. Patient is incontinent at baseline. Son reported that patient has been having seizure like episodes for about 6 months. She has no history of seizure. CK was normal at 63. She had a 20 minute EEG showing encephalopathy with multiple spikes, without evidence of seizure. Per neurology recommendations, the patient was started on Keppra 500mg BID.  She also had a 24 hour EEG which showed similar findings to 20 minute EEG. Upon discharge she will have an outpatient extended EEG after one week of treatment and follow up with neurology. 

# Pneumonia: Patient presented with new oxygen requirement. CXR noted bibasilar opacities which may reflect atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded. A repeat CXR on ___ showed a left pleural effusion and an area of newly appeared left parenchymal consolidation in the retrocardiac and left basal lung areas. The patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia. She received a PICC line for continued antibiotic therapy. 

# Hypernatremia: Sodium elevated to 147 on admission (previous admission ranged from 141-144). Given baseline dementia and altered mental status this may be due to patient not being able to get water. Patient became unable to in PO hydration and was given about 1 Liter of D5W for hypernatremia on most days.

# Goals of Care: Patient admitted with poor functional baseline. She deteriorated during this admission in the setting of a recent stroke, possible seizure activity, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. The patient was unable to take in oral medications or food and was supplemented with D5W. A speech and swallow evaluation was done and the patient was unable to safely take in anything by mouth. She may improve with treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection and should be reevaluated at that time. If her functional status continues to be depressed, particularly with swallowing, a goals of care discussion will be needed by the team of providers at ___ ___ who know the patient best.

# C difficile: A clostridium difficile toxin was checked due to high white blood cell count. The patient was not symptomatic from this and was having ___ bowel movements per day. Because of her poor baseline functioning, she was started on IV flagyl and will need to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics.

# Chronic renal failure: Cr on admission 1.4. Baseline per ___ records is 1.5-1.7. Medications were renally dosed.

# Dementia: Patient has baseline dementia and is oriented times zero. She was placed on ___ protocol. Conditions that may exacerbate dementia were treated as described. 

# HTN: Patient continued on home metoprolol tartrate 25 mg daily.

# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. TSH low at 0.23, Free T4 6.6 and Free T3 64. She was switched to 50 mcg of IV levothyroxine due to inability to swallow pills.
