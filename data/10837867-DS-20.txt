 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Dizzy spells  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___ - AVR(23mm ___ Valve), CABGx1(Left internal mammary->Left anterior descending artery). ___ - Cardiac Catheterization

 History of Present Illness: I recently had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ___ in consultation. As you recall, he is a ___- year-old gentleman with a history of aortic stenosis and now dizzy spells for the past three months. Recent EKG was performed which showed some inferior Q waves and a follow up echocardiogram was also performed which showed that his aortic stenosis has had now become severe. His aortic valve area previously was 0.8 cm2 and now is 0.5 cm2. Given these findings, he has now been referred for surgical evaluation. Independent review of his cardiac echocardiogram from ___ again showed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2. His mean gradient is 52 mmHg and he has mild mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, an ejection fraction of 65%, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and a trileaflet aortic valve. He also had a Holter monitor placed and review of the data shows sinus rhythm with occasional PACs and PVCs. There are two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia but no significant ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

 Past Medical History: Past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, prior inferior wall MI based on Q waves on his EKG, hepatitis A, memory loss, and sleep apnea.

 Social History: ___ Family History: His family history is relatively unremarkable, however, there is a sister who had congestive heart failure in her ___.  Physical Exam: On physical examination, his pulse is 74 and regular. Respirations are 12. His blood pressure on his right is 136/78 and on his left is 130/76. He is ___ tall and weighs 190 lbs. In general, he is a well-developed and well-nourished elderly gentleman in no acute distress. Skin is warm and dry without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. HEENT examination shows him to be normocephalic and atraumatic. His pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Sclerae is anicteric. His oropharynx is benign and he does have upper and lower dentures, however, has few upper and lower gold capped teeth that remain. His neck is supple with full range of motion and no JVD. His lungs are clear are clear to auscultation. Heart shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. There is a III/VI systolic ejection murmur without rub or gallop. His abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well perfused without edema. He does have a small right thigh superficial varicosity but overall his bilateral greater saphenous vein appears suitable if needed. Pulse are 2+ throughout. Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3. There are no focal deficits. He moves all of his extremities. Gait is steady and there is some notable short-term memory loss on physical examination. There is a transmitted murmur versus bruit over his bilateral carotid arteries.

 Pertinent Results: ___ Cardiac Cath 1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed no 

angiographically apparent coronary artery disease of the LMCA, LAD, LCx or RCA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP of 120 mmHg and DBP of 71 mmHg. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred. 

___ ECHO PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The NCC is immobile. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. Trivial AI and trivial paravalvular leak prior to protamine administration. Peak gradient now 28 mmHg. Preserved biventricular systolic function. MR remains mild. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Cardiopulmonary bypass time waws 79 minutes, cross-clamp time was 62 minutes For further details, please see operative report. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transfered to the CVICU for further observation and recovery. Within ___ hours, the patient was extubated and all drips had been weaned. On POD 1 the patient was alert and oriented (with baseline short-term memory loss), breathing comfortably and off all inotropic and vasopressor support. He was found suitable for transfer to the telemetry floor at this time. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was diuresed toward his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with strength and balance. The patient went into atrial fibrillation post-operatively.  Amiodarone was started, and beta blocker was titrated up accordingly. He was still in atrial fibrillation on discharge, however, rate was well controlled. The patient developed a fever on POD 3 and cultures were sent. Urinalysis was positive, and patient was started on bactrim empirically. Hospital course was essentially uneventful and the patient was discharged to rehab on POD 5.  Medications on Admission: namenda 20 BID zocor 20 daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
