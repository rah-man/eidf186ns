 Discharge Instructions: Thank you for allowing us to take care of you here at ___ ___. You were admitted to because your home visiting nurse noticed you heart rate was elevated and you had a mild COPD excacerbatoin. We evaluated your blood to make sure you did not have a heart attack and the results of those studies showed that you did not have any heart damage or heart attack. We also asked cardiologist to examine your pacemaker to identify a possible accelerated rhythm or pacemaker malfunction that could have caused your fast heart rate. They determined that your pacemaker was functioning normally.

You were also short of breath during the hospitilzation and were given inhaled nebulizer treatments and one dose of oral steroids to reduce inflammation in your lungs and help you breath better. Please go to an Emergency room if you feel any chest pain, palpitations, severe shortness of breath, swelling of your legs or dizziness.
