 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was hospitalized at ___ due to brief episode of difficulty speaking and right sided weakness concerning for stroke or transient ischemic attack. She was admitted to the Stroke Service and monitored on telemetry. On admission, her INR was seen to be subtherapeutic at 2.3 (goal of 2.5-3.5) and she was started on IV heparin. Her home Coumadin was increased to 4mg and then 5mg due to downtrending INR. She was otherwise continued on her home medications. She underwent MRI which showed a subacute infarct in right temporal lobe. Once INR was seen to be in therapeutic range (2.8) she was discharged home with no rehab needs.

Transition Issues: -Pt will need to continue taking Coumadin 4mg daily with routine INR checks and f/u with her PCP for further control of her anticoagulation -Pt will need to follow up with Neurology in the near future  Medications on Admission: Coumadin ___ daily Lopressor 25mg BID ASA 81mg Lasix 20mg daily Albuterol PRN  Discharge Medications: 1. Warfarin 5 mg PO DAILY16 RX *warfarin [Coumadin] 5 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth Daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*0 2. Albuterol Inhaler 1 PUFF IH Q6H:PRN wheezing  3. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY  4.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute ischemic stroke

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking and left sided weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: Atrial Fibrillation Mitral Valve/Aortic Valve Replacements Heart disease Prior stroke We are changing your medications as follows: Please continue taking Coumadin at increased dose of 5mg daily. Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
