CXR (___) 1. Mild pulmonary edema has completely resolved. 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly. 

TTE (___) The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal inferior and posterior walls as well as of the apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the aortic valve orifice area is slightly incerased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (and stroke volume) are significantly increased. 

Femoral Groin US (___) No evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm.

Interventional details

The distal aortogram demonstrated diffusely diseased iliofemoral vessels with caliber > 4.0 mm. 

Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed used.  The mean aortic valve gradient was 57.38 mmHg and an aortic valve area 0.48 cm2. After a single inflation of the aortic valvuloplasty 22 mm balloon, the residual aortic valve gradient was 31.58 mmHg and the aortic valve area was 0.71 cm2.
