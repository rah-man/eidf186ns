 History of Present Illness: Patient is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a history of dyslipidemia and depression presents as a transfer from ___ for evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage.

The patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until approximately 6 pm this evening, when while standing, felt that her right leg was heavy and a bit numb. She decided to sit down for several minutes. However, she was unable to arise again and slid toward the floor. Emergency medical services were notified and the patient was brought to ___ ___ for further evaluation.

There, her blood pressure was noted to be 210/110 on arrival.  She was noted to have ___ strength of the right arm and leg, though sensory examination was reported as "normal." She underwent blood testing which revealed minimal hyponatremia (sodium 134). Coagulation studies were pending. However, a head CT revealed a "large left temporoparietal hemorrhage" approximately 39 x 30 mm in size, with some local mass effect and minimal shift. "Trace hemorrhage" was also seen on the right side in the right parieto-occipital region. There was also a possible smaller occipital focus observed (laterality not specified). She was apparently started on a nitroglycerin drip (later discontinued) and also given a dose of lorazepam 0.5 mg.

Review of Systems: She acknowleges that her memory has "not been what it used to be." She believes that her speech is "off," though not necessarily slurred. The patient denies headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, visual loss, alterations in taste, smell, or hearing, dysphagia, impaired comprehension. She denies head trauma.  Past Medical History: 1. Dyslipidemia 2. Depression 

 Social History: ___ Family History: She denies a history of neurologic disease, including stroke.

Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus. Facial sensation intact bilaterally. Facial movement normal and symmetric, though there may be some right NLFF.  Hearing intact to pillow scratch bilaterally. Palate elevates midline. Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations. Trapezii full strength on the left, trace movement on the right.

CT HEAD ___: Multiple hemorrhagic foci with the largest in the left parieto- occipital region without significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. 

MRI ___: Redemonstration of multiple hemorrhages in the parietal lobes, with additional areas of susceptibility defined that would suggest amyloid angiopathy as a potential diagnosis. Multiple cavernomas can have a similar appearance, but it is unusual for these lesions to hemorrhage simultaneously. 

 Brief Hospital Course: In summary, patient is a ___ year old woman with a h/o HTN, presents with new onset right arm and leg weakness. Symptoms preceded by some sensory phenomenon affecting her leg but unable to elucidate it further. No HA or fluctuation in symptoms since arrival. 

On exam, awake, oriented to date, locale. Speech is grammatical, fluent but unable to provide a detailed narrative. She is able to read short phrases and markedly apraxic. Face symmetrical. Right sided HP (unable to move R limbs against gravity). R-sided sensory loss with impaired JPS on the R.

On CT and MRI, parient has large L parieto-frontal hemorrhage most consistent with amyloid angiopathy. She was evaluated per ___ who recommends acute rehab and otherwise, she remained stable during this admission. She remains severely hemiparetic on R side and markedly apraxic with some confusion.

She will be discharged to acute rehabilitation facility for intense ___, OT and Speech if needed. She has follow-up appointment scheduled with Dr. ___ and is recommended to follow-up with PCP upon discharge from rehab facility.  Medications on Admission: -Zocor 40 mg daily -Paxil 20 mg daily

You had complete evaluation including MRI/A of your head which showed the large, mostly left sided hemorrhage plus multiple small, microhemorrhage most consistent with amyloid angiopathy.

You currently have R side weakness with some difficulty with learned tasks hence you have been recommended for acute rehabilitation including physical, occupational and speech therapy.
