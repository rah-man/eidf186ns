ERCP showed tight stricture in distal CBD and he underwent stenting without sphincterotomy because INR was 2.2 at that time.

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  ___ Diagnosis: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Bile Duct Obstruction Vitamin K deficiency Vitamin D deficiency Moderate malnutrition  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).  Discharge Instructions: Mr. ___,

You presented to the hospital with evidence of biliary obstruction and a pancreatic mass. You underwent a procedure called an ERCP, during which a stent was placed in your bile ducts and samples were taken. Unfortunately, these samples returned consistent with a pancreatic cancer. But fortunately, the stent that was placed helped you feel better, your jaundice improved, and your appetite improved. You are scheduled to follow-up in the ___ Pancre___ Specialty Clinic on ___, ___, at 1PM (see below for details).

You were also found to have vitamin D deficiency, likely a direct result of the biliary obstruction you had, which is now improved. We are repleting your deficiency with high-dose vitamin D, and this will need to be rechecked in ___ months by your primary care physician to ensure that your Vitamin D level is improving.

It was a pleasure caring for you and we wish you all the best.

Sincerely, Dr. ___ the ___ Medicine Team  Followup Instructions: ___
