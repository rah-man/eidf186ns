EKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___: (preliminary) 1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel disease. The ___ had 80% mid stenosis. The LAD had 100% occlusion in the mid vessel. The LCx had 70% origin stenosis. The RCA had 70-80% proximal stenosis prior to large RCA cascade. 2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA-LAD with 50-70% stenoses throughout the entire LAD and a 100% occluded diagonal branch that filled via left-to-left collaterals. The SVG-diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RCA were all occluded. 3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Patent LIMA-LAD; occluded SVGs to the OM, diagonal (new), and RCA.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ with a history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF, HTN, HLD, and CKD who was transferred to ___ for management of NSTEMI and received a DES to his ___.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 1. CAD/NSTEMI: He has an extensive history of CAD with a CABG in ___, and underwent a cardiac catheterization in ___ showing occluded SVG to OM and PDA. He presented to ___ with CHF, and was found to have an elevated troponin consistent with NSTEMI. His EKG was unchanged from ___, though ST-T wave changes may be obscured by LVH. He later underwent a pharmacologic MIBI showing a large anterolateral defect, for which he was transferred to ___ for further management.

His catheterization demonstrated an 80% LMCA stenosis which was stented with DES, along with a 70-80% proximal RCA stenosis prior to large RCA cascade that was not intervened upon. He was chest pain free prior too and following the procedure. His post-procedure cardiac enzymes showed normal CK and MB with a weakly positive troponin consistent with his recent NSTEMI.  Should his symptoms recur, he may need to return for cardiac catheterization to address his RCA disease, as the dye load was felt to be too great to address both vessels in one procedure, given his chronic kidney disease. He was discharged on a medical regimen including aspirin, plavix, carvedilol, atorvastatin, imdur. He was not on an ACE, presumably due to his CKD and hyperkalemia.

2. CHRONIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: He has systolic dysfunction with an estimated EF of ___ based on a ___ TTE. While he presented to ___ with acute heart failure, he was euvolemic on admission to ___. His home lasix dose was increased to 20mg daily, and he was discharged with instructions to have electrolytes checked several days later.

3. CONJUNCTIVITIS: He had an irritated left eye with crusting yellow discharge. He was treated with a 5 day course of erythromycin drops.

INACTIVE PROBLEMS: 4. HYPERTENSION: His carvedilol, amlodipine were continued. 5. CKD: He has CKD stage III with creatinine remaining at baseline of 1.5. He is on daily kayexalate, presumably due to hyperkalemia from his kidney disease, which was not required in house. Continued paricalcitol. 6. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Placed on high dose atorvastatin for ACS. 7. DEPRESSION: Euthymic, on paroxetine.
