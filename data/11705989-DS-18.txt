 History of Present Illness: ___ dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 20% with TR/MR, h/o VT s/p single chamber ICD (fidelis lead), afib on coumadin who is directly admitted from Dr ___ for ICD lead and generator replacement. 

Pt reports that he was in his USOH until last night when his pacemaker started alarming. He had a visit already scheduled with Dr. ___ today so presented for evaluation. ICD interrogation showed that his fidelis lead was inappropriately sensing. The ICD had been alarming for short V-V, noise on pace/sense, resulting in detections for VF. No shocks were given. The ICD was programmed off and he was transferred to ___ for new lead placement and generator change. 

On arrival to the floor, he has no complaints. He denies chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope or actual syncope. He has chronic 2+ lower extremity edema. 

Of note, Mr. ___ was hospitalized for approximately one week last month with RML PNA. Since that time, he has felt relatively weak. He continues to have dyspnea during modest physical exertion and continues to utilize ___ liters of supplemental oxygen at night. He is undergoing evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea. He has paroxysmal dyspnea at night, which finds him gasping for air in the middle of the night. It is difficult to ascertain whether this is orthopnea or his presumptive sleep apnea.  

Review of sytems:  (+) Per HPI  (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Ten point review of systems is otherwise negative.

At that time, he was started on amiodarone but had GI upset/nausea so he was put on dofetilide.  5. History of prior right-sided pacemaker, which was explanted, but the leads were capped.  6.

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: FIDELIS LEAD MALFUNCTION; VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA; NEW ICD LEAD PLACEMENT AND GENERATOR CHANGE; CHRONIC COMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted because your pacemaker/defibrillator needed a new battery and a new defibrillator lead to the heart. The proceudre was uncomplicated. While you have a complicated medical history, your problems were stable during your admission. You will need to followup in the device clinic in one week and take an antibiotic called Keflex for seven days. Also, please weigh yourself daily and if your weight goes up by more than three pounds, call your cardiologist or PCP. Discharge weight 81.1 kg.

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
