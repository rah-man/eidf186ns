Cath: ___ 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was free of angiographically apparant coronary artery disease. The LAD had a 60% lesion in its mid segment, and an 80% lesion in the D1. The LCx had a hazy 95% lesion at a bifurcation of the OM1 with extension back into the proximal LCx. The proximal RCA had a diffuse, 80-90% lesion with a aneurysmal vs. ulcerated segment. The mid RCA had a 50% lesion. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 132/73 mmHg. The LVEDP was moderately elevated at 23 mmHg consistent with moderate diastolic heart failure. There was no gradient across the aortic valve with pullback. 3. Successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with Integrity RX 2.5 x 18 mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX vessel. Upper pole of OM branch was pre-dilated. Excellent result. 4. Ongoing discomfort during procedure, so decided to proceed to intervention on proximal RCA lesion. Successful PCI with Integrity RX 3.0 x 26 mm bare metal stent with excellent result. 

5. Successful hemostasis at right femoral arterial access site using ___ Fr Exoseal vascular closure device. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Normal systemic arterial blood pressure. 3. Moderately elevated LVEDP consistent with moderate diastolic heart failure. 4. Inferolateral STEMI with successful PCI using BMI of LCX/OM and proximal RCA. 5. Aspirin 81 mgs daily indefinitely, Clopidogrel 75 mgs for minimum 6 weeks. . TTE: ___ The left atrium is markedly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ female w/ a hx of CAD, Afib, valvular heart disease (MR+TR) who presented to ___ complaining of CP radiating to jaw for 3 days. On work up found to have ST elevation inferiorlateral MI transfered urgently to cath lab at ___. .  #STEMI: EKG at ___ notable for ST elevations in AvF, III, and v5, v6 and had (+)trop which was concerning for LCx teritory STEMI. She was transferred to ___ for urgent cath. In the cath lab, patient was found to have blockage of OM and RCA. Patient had successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with Integrity RX 2.5 x 18 mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX vessel. Subsequently patient continued to have ongoing discomfort during procedure, so decision was ___ to proceed to intervention on proximal RCA lesion with successful PCI with Integrity RX 3.0 x 26 mm bare metal stent with excellent result. Patient was transfered to CCU for monitoring where she remained free of chest pain. She was continued of aspirin and started on clobidogrel, atorvastain, valsartan. Her home metorprolol dose was also increased. She had TTE once day after cath which showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall with EF 50-55%.  She was seen by physical theraphy on the day of discahrged and deemed safe to go home with services. She will follow up with cardiologist Dr. ___ further ___ of her CAD.  . #AFIB: Stable; She was rate controlled with metoprolol and discahrged on Metoporlol XL 50mg daily. She was continued on Pradaxa. . # Acute on Chornic Diastolic CHF: Patient's contined to be euvolemic. ON day of discharge she had swelling of her foot therefore she was restarted on her home lasix dose. She continued to have good oxygen saturation and stable from respiratory stanpoint. . # Hypertension: Her Blood pressure was well controlled on metoprolol. Valsartan was added on day of discharge but BP dec to 90/50 so was not prescribed on discharge. . # Hyperlidiemia: She was started on atorvatatin. . #Anemia: Most likely secondary to chronic GI bleed ___ to peptic ulcer.
