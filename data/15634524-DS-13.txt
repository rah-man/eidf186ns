Chief Complaint: CC: ___ Reason for OSH transfer: pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis with obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none

 History of Present Illness: Mr ___ is a ___ with heavy smoking, AAA s/p endovascular repair ___, HTN, HCV cirrhosis with esophageal varices (never bled, never banded), who presents from ___ with pancreatitis and CT scan reportedly showing choledocholithiasis (CBD stone).

He felt well until the ___ afternoon prior to presentation, when he ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and became nauseated. It continued over the course of the day, getting progressively worse. On ___, he started to develop epigastric and bandlike abdominal pain, which was also described as gassy in character. This worsened over the course of the day, and brought him into ___.

At ___, he was reportedly stable. Labs showed pancreatitis, elevated LFTs, and CT scan of the abdomen showed pancreatic head and duodenal stranding and CBD stone, by report. He was given Unasyn there, for unclear reasons. He was then transferred to the ___.

In the ___ ED, he had stable vital signs, and repeat labs confirmed transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and pancreatitis. He was given Zosyn and then admission was requested.

Upon arrival, his Plts are noted to be 12, and review of his records calls into question the finding of CBD stone -- not mentioned on CT scan read, and ERCP team cannot find it. I spoke with radiology and they confirm that they do not see a stone on this study, but there is some intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Recommended MRCP and dynamic liver for further eval.

ROS: A complete 10-point ROS was completed and is otherwise negative in detail except per HPI.  Past Medical History: HCV cirrhosis - previously attempted old generation treatment, no recent VL on file Esophageal varices - reportedly stable for years, last endoscopy was ___ year ago; ___ EGD in OMR showed grade 3 varices HTN Seasonal allergies

IMAGING

Chest portable ___: The patient has severe emphysema. New heterogeneous opacification confined to the right lower lobe is pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage or both. There is no pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Bulging contour to the left diaphragmatic pleural surface it is due to a documented Bochdalek's diaphragmatic hernia transmitting subphrenic fat. 

ECG ___: Normal sinus rhythm. Suspect acute myocardial infarction anterolaterally with marked increase in ST-T wave abnormalities in comparison to tracing #1. TRACING #2 

ECG ___: Normal sinus rhythm. Anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities. Consider acute myocardial infarction. The Q-T interval is borderline prolonged. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the T wave abnormalities are less marked. Marked left axis deviation persists as does evidence of recent anteroseptal myocardial infarction. TRACING #1  Chest pa/lat ___: Heart size is mildly enlarged, stable. Mediastinal contours are stable. Lungs are essentially clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No new focal consolidations to suggest interval development of infection demonstrated 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm with a slightly prolonged computed QTc interval. QS complexes in leads V1-V2 with poor anterior R wave progression in lead V3 with T wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and V2-V6 suggest recent anterolateral myocardial infarction in evolution. There is left axis deviation and left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ ST segment elevation is less prominent in lead V2 but slightly more prominent in lead V1 suggesting recent injury or post infarction aneurysm formation. QTc interval remains prolonged. Alternatively, an ongoing anterolateral ischemic process cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is suggested. 

ECG ___: Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Consider left anterior fascicular block. QTc interval prolongation. Q waves in leads V1-V2 and late R wave progression with early precordial ST segment elevation and T wave inversion. Possible anterolateral myocardial infarction or metabolic derangements. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the QTc interval is longer at a slower rate and T wave inversions are new in the precordial leads. Clinical correlation is suggested. 

Chest portable ___: As compared to ___ radiograph, a right lower lobe consolidation and focal left basilar atelectasis have resolved. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. There are Q waves in the anterior leads with ST segment elevation and additional ST-T wave changes consistent with ischemia or infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ ST segment elevation and ST-T wave changes are much more significant. 

Tissue: BONE MARROW, BIOPSY, CORE  ___ NOTE: Erythroid dominant bone marrow aspirate with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. While no overt myeloid dysplasia seen, the core biopsy is nondiagnostic because is lacks hematopoietic cellular elements.

Chest pa/lat ___: 1. Near resolution of pulmonary edema. 2. New right lower lobe airspace opacity, which may reflect aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia here 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Non-specific ST segment changes. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the suggestion of a possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction is less pronounced. Lateral ST segment depressions persist. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Anterior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the lateral ST segment depressions are slightly more apparent. 

CXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema has increased. The patient is now in moderate pulmonary edema. With mild interstitial components. Moderate cardiomegaly. Mild elongation of the descending aorta. No larger pleural effusions. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Probable prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the ST segment depression is less pronounced in lead V6 and the QRS change in lead V4 could be due to lead placement.   ECHO ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis. The other segments are relatively hyperdynamic. Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction as described above and apical righ ventricular hypokinesis consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, image quali is improved on the current study. The anterior/septal segments were probably hypokinetic on the prior study also. Estimated pulmonary pressures are higher. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST segment elevation through lead V3. Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Lateral and inferior ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ Q waves and ST segment elevation in the early precordial leads are now more apparent. ST segment depressions in the lateral leads are also more prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested. 

___ ___: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremity veins.

CTA chest ___: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. Atherosclerotic plaque of the aorta and coronary arteries. 2. Diffuse peribronchial/bronchial wall thickening compatible with bronchitis, however, in combination with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and further evaluation with repeat chest CT after resolution of current symptoms is recommended to ensure resolution of these findings. 3. Paraseptal emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusions and interlobular septal thickening compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion. 4. Findings consistent with hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension including splenomegaly and varices. Mild bilateral renal lesions, including 2 cysts in the right upper pole and a left upper pole hypodensity too small to characterize. 

Chest portable ___: 1. Mild pulmonary edema. 2. Tiny right effusion. 

ECHO ___: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave transition. Non-specific ST segment changes. No previous tracing available for comparison. 

MRCP ___: Cirrhosis with sequela of portal hypertension.  Multifocal, patchy areas of abnormal signal and enhancement, most suggestive of inflammatory fibrosis. Given associated dilated segment 4A/8 peripheral ducts, subclinical cholangitis should be considered. Given lack of washout, tumor is thought to be less likely. However, as this is not entirely excluded, correlation with AFP and consideration of biopsy and/or short term (3 months) MRI follow up is recommended. 

CXR ___: 1. Nodular opacities within right upper lobe may represent mucous plugging and small airways disease. 2. 8 mm rounded opacification the left lobe lung may reflect a nipple shadow. Followup chest radiographs with and without nipple markers in 8 weeks is recommended. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course: Mr. ___ is a ___ y M with PMH significant for recent AAA repair, HTN, and HCV cirrhosis who transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of pancreatitis, whose course was complicated by acute on chronic thombocytopenia, with contributions from hypersplenism and ITP, requiring IVIG transfusions, steroids, and rituxan. His hospital course was further complicated by NSTEMI, associated temporally with the aforementioned infusions, with management of ACS limited by thrombocytopenia. He died on ___ after experiencing torsades and ventricular fibrillation, despite efforts to resuscitate him.

Active issues:

#Torsades/VF: On ___, he was noted to be in VF and a code was called. He died despite efforts to resuscitate him. Review of telemetry was notable for torsades followed by VF. He had been on low doses of trazodone, which had been discontinued in the preceding days, as he was noted to have QT prolongation. The etiology may have been myocardial ischemia, given post-NSTEMI state.

# Thrombocytopenia: While he had chronically low platelets due to his cirrhosis (50-80s over the last ___ years), his platelet count dropped dramatically to the teens during this admission, which was attributed to ITP and splenic sequestration. Consumptive, productive, and sequestrative processes were considered. BM biopsy was reassuring against infiltrative process and showed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Blood smear showed anisocytosis with hypochromic erythrocytes, increased numbers of reticulocytes, normal numbers of leukocytes, hypersegmented polymorphonuclear cells, decreased numbers of platelets with normal platelet morphology; therefore, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was not likely. His fibrinogen was low, consistent with coagulopathy secondary to liver disease. He was treated with 3 doses IVIG, steroids, and rituximab given in MICU, in an attempt to treat ITP. Splenic embolization was considered as well, however, he was not thought to be stable enough to withstand the procedure. His infusion course was complicated -- Rituximab administration on ___ was complicated by chest pain. He also received 10 units of cryoprecipitate on ___ for dropping fibrinogen. In addition, on ___, he completed a 4-day pulse dexamethasone (40mg/day) course, unfortunately with suboptimal response. Platelet transfusions were given with a goal platelet count >10, with concurrent diuresis after IVIG and platelet transfusions were temporally associated with NSTEMI thought to be due to increased myocardial demand in the setting of volume load (see below for details re: ACS). The persistence and degree of thrombocytopenia precluded aggressive treatment of acute coronary syndrome. 

# Hemoptysis: Mr. ___ began having hemoptysis ___, with small amounts of bloody sputum and cough. In the setting of profound thrombocytopenia, there was concern for spontaneous pulmonary hemorrhage v. PNA, and CXR was notable for a new heterogeneous opacification confined to the right lower lobe, called pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or both. The episodes of hemoptysis did not compromise his respiratory status, and he was breathing comfortably and hemodynamically stable. He was treated with one dose of PO Amicar in the setting of ongoing hemoptysis, after consultation with hematology and cardiology. A TB rule-out was also initiated, despite low suspicion based on his radiographic findings and remote exposure (a family member in the ___ exposed him to TB, and he had had subsequent negative PPDs). 

# acute coronary syndrome: On ___, after an IVIG infusion, he complained of shortness of breath, and an EKG was demonstrated dynamic EKG changes (ST elevation 1mm V1-3, ST depressions II/II, AvF, and subsequently V4-5). He subsequently developed chest pressure, and ECHO on ___ consistent with mid-LAD lesion. EKG on ___epression in inferior leads and subtle ST elevations in precordial leads (V1-V3). His chest pain resolved with nitropaste/morphine. Enzymes showed uptrending troponin and new elevated CKMB. He was treated with atorvastatin 80, spironolactone 25, metoprolol succinate 50. Aspirin was held given thrombocytopenia. Coronary catheterization was deferred until platelets stable and >50, a threshold that was unfortunately not achieved, and platelet transfusions had to be given with lasix to decrease the volume load of infusion, as platelet transfusions were temporally associated with recurrence of chest pain.  # SOB: He initially noted dyspnea in the setting of fluid overload after getting IVIG, and he continued to feel SOB after platelet transfusions. Underlying COPD may have contributed, for which nebs were provided. Chest x-ray on ___ without evidence of pulmonary edema, but some concern for RLL infiltrate; repeat CXR on ___ raised concern for PNA, and he was treated with vancomycin/cefepime. He was afebrile, and his cough was productive of bloody sputum as above. There was also likely contribution from diastolic CHF, for which he was treated with torsemide 40 mg on ___, which was subsequently held given increase in creatinine and euvolemia, and transitioned to PO lasix 20 mg daily, starting on ___. Additionally, he was treated with incentive spirometry, and morphine Sulfate (Oral Soln.) 2.5-5 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN chest discomfort per palliative care recs. 

# HCV Cirrhosis: complicated by esophageal varices (no hx of bleeding/banding), no HE, no ascites. On presentation, his HCV viral load = 1,580,000. Given that he was HBcAb+, sAb negative, he was started on prophylaxis for HBV reactivation with lamivudine 100mg daily in the setting of receiving IVIG, steroids, and rituximab for treatment of ITP. He was planning to have HCV treatment once medically stable and a surveillance EGD once his platelets stabilized. 

# Elevated LFTs: initial elevation with AST: ALT ratio 2:1 consistent with history of alcohol use. Imaging was notable for bile duct strictures; CA ___ level was subsequently checked and was elevated at 282. He had plans for repeat MRI (with ___ protocol) and MRCP for follow up as an outpatient to better evaluate bile duct strictures in 3 months per GI.  

# Pancreatitis: Resolved; no abdominal pain, tolerating POs. On initial presentation had N/V, epigastric tenderness, WBC 8.3, lipase 1100, bili 6.1, and mild transaminitis. CT at that time showed inflammation and stranding in pancreatic head and duodenum. Etiology likely due to alcohol. Ddx also includes gallstone which subsequently passed. 

# Thrush: Nystatin swish and swallow was provided.   Chronic issues:  # HTN: Continued propranolol, lisinopril. # Recent AAA repair: Stable. Continued Simvastatin.
