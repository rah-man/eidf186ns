IMAGING:

___ CTA abdomen/pelvis:  1. Grossly unchanged appearance of the aorta and its major tributaries, status post aorto bi-iliac stents. Patent superior mesenteric artery. Stable mild ectasia of the right internal iliac artery. 2. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abnormalities.  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of EVAR in ___ and SMA stent in ___, followed by Dr. ___ seen in clinic on ___ with a mesenteric duplex showing celiac artery in-stent stenosis of the SMA of 70-99%, history of chronic abdominal pain, who presented to ___ with increasing epigastric pain for 4 days. She reported that she felt constipated prior to admission and then had several loose bowel movement which then prompted cramping and stabbing epigastric pain. She also endorsed nausea, but no vomiting. She denied any bloody stools. She was passing flatus and currently having regular bowel movements, last BM was this afternoon and flatus was a 30 minutes ago. She denied any postprandial pain or recent weight loss. She was been on a clear liquid diet at ___ and tolerating well. Her initial CT scan at admission revealed borderline prominent small bowel loops in the lower abdomen and pelvis. She later underwent an aortoiliac duplex which showed high velocity flow at the origin and at the proximal level. She was transferred to the vascular surgery service at ___ for evaluation of possible mesenteric ischemia as the etiology of her abdominal symptoms. 

On arrival, she was started on a heparin drip and underwent a CTA, which demonstrated a SMA stenosis, celiac artery stenosis, and mild ectasia of the right hypogastric artery, all of which were stable from prior imaging. As such, vascualr surgery believed that mesenteric ischemia was most likely not contributing to her acute abdominal pain, and the patient was not taken for a mesenteric angiogram. 

Gastroenterology was consulted to see the patient. She was started on omeprazole and given bowel medications as she had not moved her bowels in 6 days. On ___, her abdominal pain had improved significantly. She was tolerating a regular diet and able to have a bowel movement. She was deemed ready for discharge to home, and she was given appropriate follow up instructions. She was scheduled to see Dr. ___ in 1 month with repeait mesenteric duplex and CTA (for her EVAR). She was also scheduled to see outpatient gastroenterology for furhter work up and management of her chronic abdominal pain.
