 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, obesity, CAD s/p MI w/ PCI c/b left circumflex perforation, DMII, hypertension, chronic myeloid leukemia s/p SCT c/b GVHD, and chronic ulcerations on her pannus who presents with concern for loss of pulses in her lower extremities. 

In terms of her PVD, she is s/p bilateral iliac stenting (___) with subsequent occlusion and recent ABI of 0.2 bilaterally. Per vascular surgery, the plan has been consideration of bilateral amputations vs. bypass surgery, but this has been difficult in light of chronic MRSA-infected ulcerations in her pannus requiring multiple hospitalizations at ___. She was referred to plastic surgery for management of these ulcerations. Plastics has recommended weekly debridements with ultimate panniculectomy. 

On ___, she presented for routine follow-up at ___ where she was noted to appear "anemic and undernourished" by nursing staff. She was sent to ___ where she was found to have no distal ___ pulses and was sent to ___ for evaluation by plastics and vascular surgery. 

In the ED, vascular surgery was consulted. They noted discoloration of her right first toe and concern for gangrene in the tips of her left ___ and ___ toes. There were no palpable pulses in the lower extremities, which apparently is her baseline. She was noted to have had a CTA at OSH with three-vessel runoff. They determined that there were no acute vascular surgery needs. 

She later became agitated and was noted to be yelling, cursing, and kicking and swatting staff. She was given IM olanzapine and Haldol. She stated that she was in a house and that she was going to call the police. She removed her PIV and refused vitals checks and medications. She later became more calm, but continued to be disoriented and called the police. 

In the ED, initial vital signs were notable for: T 98.3F HR 70 BP 128/43 RR 16 O2 99% RA 

Exam notable for: - Pannus with multiple ulcerations with surrounding erythema and fibrinous exudate covered by gauze. 3 large ulcerations measuring 4-8cm lengthwise and multiple 1-3cm punctate ulcerations. - 8x3cm ulcer over sacrum. - No DP or posterior tibial pulses bilaterally, dorsum of feet are warm. ___ digit of both feet dusky with dry blackened scabs, duskiness over ___ digits, no exudate.

She was found to have stable arterial disease but persistent ischemic pannus ulcers, and underwent Panniculectomy on ___ with plastic surgery. Course also complicated by UTI s/p 7d abx, delirium on presumed dementia, and anemia. 

#CHRONIC PANNUS ULCERATIONS #NUTRITION Patient with chronic MRSA-infected ulcerations of the intertriginous zone of her pannus requiring multiple hospitalizations. Plastics has been following as outpatient with for consideration of panniculectomy after medical clearance. Wound care nurse consulted. Wounds were redressed Qd. Plastic surgery team requested nutrition, dermatology, and cardiology evaluation for pre-operative assessment. Per nutrition, patient continued on multivitamin with minerals, and continued on 10 day course of ascorbic acid ___ daily (___) and 10 day course of vitamin A ___ units (___). Zinc level was sent, normal. Dermatology thought the most likely etiology of her ulcers was her arterial disease, less likely infectious or pyoderma gangrenosum. Cardiology evaluated patient to perform pre-operative risk stratification, was considering intervention given her history of CAD with Lcirc CTO, but decided against this given small affected territory and presence of collaterals. She was deemed to have at least 3 risk factors, corresponding to a predicted risk of ~9% for major cardiac complications, recommended continuing aspirin but from cardiac standpoint does not need DAPT. Uncomplicated Panniculectomy was completed on ___. Wound vac and 2 JP drains were left in place on discharge with plan for followup in Plastic Surgery clinic on ___ for removal. 

# PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE # ARTERIAL ULCERS # GANGRENE of MULTIPLE TOES Patient with history of severe PVD s/p bilateral iliac stenting with subsequent occlusion. She has had a long standing ulceration on the right first toe and more recently pain and discoloration on the left second and third toes. She was recently evaluated as outpatient by vascular surgeon Dr. ___ consideration of revascularization vs. amputation, but surgical intervention has been limited by her recurrent pannus infections. Patient initially presented to ED given c/f no palpable pulses, but per vascular surgery evaluation, her exam is stable with no palpable pulses but with dopplerable femoral and ___ pulses. CTA with e/o 3 vessel runoff. Vascular surgery with no plan for inpatient surgical intervention, would consider bypass after panniculectomy. Patient continued on ASA, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. 

#TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY #UTI #Cognitive impairment In the ED, the patient became acutely agitated and confused requiring antipsychotics and a 1:1 sitter. Potential etiologies included infectious, metabolic, delirium, and medications. As she had known chronic ulcers on her pannus with leukocytosis on admission (___ 18), initial c/f pannus infection, although Plastics team eval in ED with low concern for secondary cellulitis. Initial ED labs without clear metabolic derangement. CXR ___ negative. UA showing large leuks, neg nitrites, started CTX/vanc for UTI, transitioned to Bactrim to complete a 7d course (through ___. Bcx, Ucx NGTD. Patient did not have any agitation after transfer to the floor, although had ongoing memory issues through admission (AxOx2, aware that it is ___ but cannot provide correct date), some inattention. Per discussion with daughters this may be baseline, as they have had concerns over past year about their mother's memory. They questioned her ability to care for herself at her assisted living facility. ___ evaluated her and recommended rehab.

#URINARY RETENTION Patient was found to have urinary retention on bladder scans. It was thought this could be related to her UTI but it did not resolve. She was not symptomatic. IT was felt she likely has baseline urinary retention, with overflow incontinence. Outpatient urinary retention was arranged. 

#MICROCYTIC ANEMIA #IRON DEFICIENCY Baseline Hgb ___. Hgb 7.8 on presentation and stable. Reported history of PUD on PPI. Home omeprazole continued as inpatient. Daily hemoglobin/hematocrit trended and stable during admission. Active T&S maintained for patient. Did receive 1 pRBC transfusion as inpatient. Received IV Iron infusions for severe iron deficiency.

#Generalized Body Pain Patient endorsing severe total body pain, appears to be located in the abdomen and around this pressure ulcers. Have been up titrating her pain regimen carefully given history of sedation with large doses of oral Dilaudid. Gave Tylenol to 1g Q6H standing, increased Tramadol, added PO dilaudid for better pain control. 

#Arm tremors Her family noted new tremors that appear to be in both arms and into and occasionally whole body tremors that started while she is in rehab. These worsened while she was here and have been improving over the last few days prior to discharge. There was concern that they were related to increased pain. Pain regimen has been up titrated to good effect. At this point her tremor is most pronounced when she is making an effort, such as holding herself up on the side of the bed. Likely related to deconditioning and improved dramatically from admission. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #CAD With MI s/p PCI complicated by LCx perforation, s/p a failed CTO PCI in ___ and subsequent cath in ___ that showed ongoing CTO of LCx with distal collaterals. Continued home Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg PO DAILY, Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. Evaluated by cardiology (see above) for pre-operative assessment and cleared for surgery without needing preoperative catheterization. She did not have a history of stent and after consultation with cardiology the Plavix was discontinued. 

#SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER Eschar covered sacral wound noted on R buttock. Patient provided with Qd wound dressings. On ___ after her panniculectomy her ulcer was debrided in the OR with eschar removal and found to be Stage II. Wound care followed along and provided recommendations for care as inpatient. 

#HYPERTENSION Continued on home amLODIPine 5 mg PO/NG DAILY and Losartan Potassium 50 mg PO/NG DAILY.

#DMII Maintained on insulin sliding scale as inpatient. Initially provided with insulin glargine 45 U QHS but blood sugars were low, downtitrated to 12 units. Metformin held and restarted on discharge. 

#OSA Noted to desat at night during recent hospitalizations. No e/o of desaturations during inpatient stay. Patient did not require supplemental oxygen/CPAP. 

#ANXIETY #DEPRESSION Continued home Escitalopram Oxalate 10 mg PO/NG DAILY.

Transitional Issues: ============== [] Consider urology f/u as outpatient given ongoing urinary retention [] Ensure ongoing Vascular surgery follow up and management of PVD and necrotic toes [] Please follow wound care recommendations for Foot ulcer management [] Patient with Stage II sacral pressure ulcer, please continue wound care and outpatient management [] Follow up with Plastic surgery on ___ for assessment of pannus wound and potential removal of vac and drains. [] Wound vac should be return to ___ at ___ appointment. If at that appointment it is felt that her wound vac should be continued, then please substitute for rehab-provided wound vac. [] Neuro-cognitive appointment made on discharge for testing given c/f dementia [] Insulin was significantly downtitrated on admission from 45 U lantus to 12U lantus at discharge due to presumed poor oral intake. PLease monitor blood sugars and increase insulin as appropriate. [] Her Clopidogrel was stopped as she did not have any coronary stents and vascular surgery felt this was not needed for her iliac stents or her vascular disease. [] She had persistent anemia during this admission, was transfused one unit of pRBCs on ___ with good blood count response. She also had persistent leukocytosis (with normal differential), but given her history of CML s/p SCT we felt it was important for her to follow up with her oncologist at ___ ___. Please arrange this for ___ weeks after discharge. [] f/u CBC in 1 week to ensure not Hgb downtrending (discharge hgb 7.7). Please also follow up her WBC count, which was elevated to 19 at discharge. If WBC continues to rise, please complete infectious evaluation and also ensure referral to her Oncologist at ___ who has been following her for CML. [] Continue Bactrim DS BID x7d for possible infection from pannus surgery. (___)
