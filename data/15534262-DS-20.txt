___ BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL 

Imaging: CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple new bilateral nodular opacities with CT halo sign, the largest in the superior segment of the left lower lobe (16 x 16 mm) are concerning for aspergillosis fungal infection. 2. No lymphadenopathy, stable small pericardial effusion. 

CT abdomen and pelvis: 1. No intra-abdominal or pelvic collections. Minimal free fluid within the pelvis. Pericholecystic fluid and periportal edema which may be due to hypoalbuminemia although there is no other evidence of third spacing.  2. A 4mm ground-glass pulmonary nodule is seen in the right middle lobe, which was not present on the previous CT. This may be infective in nature.Correlation with CT thorax ___ is recommended. 

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ w/ AML who presents w/ fever, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and failure to thrive.  .  # Pseudomonas bacteremia, Klebsiella/E.coli Pneumonia: Patient developed neutropenic fever and septic picture soon after admission. She was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), with limitations based on her many allergies. Zosyn was run over 4 hours every 8 hours to achieve better levels in the blood. She also had findings on CT scan of the chest concerning for fungal infection, so BAL was performed. BAL was negative for fungal infection and instead revealed E.coli and Klebsiella. Since voriconazole dose was determined to be dosed at double the normal dose, it was decreased down to 200mg PO Q12. No other fungal therapy was initiated during hospitalization. Ultimately, Ms. ___, but never recovered her counts. Though ideally she would complete a course of IV antibiotics given pseudomonal bacteremia, ultimately goals of care discussion led her to decide to switch to PO antibiotics (cefpodoxime) instead and go home rather than go to an extended care facility. 

# Skin lesions: Derm was consulted for the following lesions: -- Skin type II, mild dermatoheliosis -- On R upper chest, rough erythematous patch -- On L dorsal hand 7 mm hyperkeratotic cutaneous horn with mildly erythematous base. non-tender -- On R extensor arm, 5 mm shiny, waxy skin colored plaque on distal aspect. there is a 5 mm hyperkeratotic plaque with erythematous base proximally

On the left, felt to be keratoacanthoma (rapidly growing squamous cell cancer variant) vs SCC vs verruca (in setting of immunosuppression) vs less likely seborrheic keratoses or lichenoid keratoses. The hyperkeratotic lesions on the R extensor arm were most likely a hypertrophic actinic keratoses or lichenoid keratoes. Patient will need outpatient follow-up for potential removal if in lines with goals of care.

# AML: After discussion with outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___ opted not to undergo further aggressive chemotherapy and instead to focus on quality of life at her own home. She changed her code status from full code to DNR on this admission as well. Her brother (HCP) and social work were also present for this discussion.
