 Name: ___          Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lactose  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Cardiac Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Femoral central venous line (removed before discharge) ___ placement  History of Present Illness: Patient ___ male with a past medical history of subdural hemorrhage status post drainage x3 ___, CKD, hypertension, CAD, seizure disorder, hyponatremia who presents as a transfer status post ROSC. 

Patient had a recent hospitalization at ___ where he had a right frontoparietal burr holes for evacuation of subdural hematoma after a mechanical fall. It appears that his hospitalization was complicated by respiratory distress followed by trach and PEG placement. Course also c/b pneumonia for which he has been on cefazolin. Also concerns for blood stream infection for which he has been on antibiotics. Discharged to ___ on ___. 

It appears that around 10 ___, patient was increasingly agitated. Around 1012 pm, he was noted to be without a pulse so CPR was started until 1019 pm. There were no shockable rhythms. No medications were given. Patient regained his pulse and transferred to the hospital for further evaluation. History severe limited due to patient's mental status and acuity. History obtained from ___ home records and EMS. 

In the ED,  - Initial Vitals: HR 103, BP 69/43, RR 15, 99% vent - Labs: Trop 0.16->0.34, MB 49. - Imaging: ___: 1. Chronic, bilateral subdural hematomas, measuring up to 8 mm in greatest dimension along the right cerebral convexity. No areas of increased density to suggest acute subdural hematoma. No mass effect. No large territorial infarction. 2. Age-related global parenchymal loss and likely sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. - Consults: Cardiac - Interventions: Sedated with midazolam, Targeted Temperature Management Protocol, placed on vent. Given Vanc/Cefepime

At rehab he had been a 24-hour 1:1 because although at baseline he is alert and oriented he had become increasingly restless and agitated. At the rehab they had been weaning his trach with a red cap and no O2. He was having intermittent desaturations but was on continuous pulse ox and these were brief and improved with suctioning. ___ his RN he had some but not a terribly large amount of secretions. Tonight he was reportedly alert and oriented at the time of his shift, but very restless. He was given his scheduled melatonin and trazodone at the beginning of the shift without event around 10pm. at that point the RN left the room and was called back by the aid around ___ as the patient was pale, with no pulse. They did compressions but confirmed no shocks or medications given. The RT bagged him. He regained a pulse but was minimally responsive, unclear if any spontaneous movements. EKG after the event showed an irregular rhythm. ___ RN did not recall any specific alarms going off.  Past Medical History: SDH, s/p drainage x3 at ___ Hyponatremia CKD, unknown baseline but BUN/crea 1.0 on ___ remained around 1.1 Gout HTN CAD, s/p MI left cath ___ Seizure disorder Essential tremor

Studies: ___ CXR 1. No focal consolidation. Increased lucency of both lung fields is likely consistent with underlying chronic lung disease. 2. Tracheostomy tube is difficult to assess due to patient rotation, but appears in place. 3. Retrocardiac opacification with silhouetting hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in left lower lobe and probably small pleural effusion. 

___ CT 1. Chronic, small bilateral subdural hematomas. 2. Advanced brain parenchymal atrophy, chronic small vessel ischemic changes, small cerebellar chronic infarcts.. 

___ ECHO Left ventricular cavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction most c/w coronary artery disease. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation

___ CXR for ___ placement INDICATION: ___ year old man with Left PICC// Left PICC 45cm IMPRESSION: Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Left retrocardiac consolidation has improved but there is interval development of substantial vascular congestion. Left PICC line tip was at the level of lower SVC. No pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural effusion. Tracheostomy is in place.

 Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY ======= ___ is an ___ year-old male with a past medical history of subdural hemorrhage status post drainage x3 ___, CKD, hypertension, CAD, seizure disorder, UTI who presented as a transfer after cardiac arrest, status-post ROSC. He was hypotensive in the ED and started on targeted temperature management and transferred to the ICU. Course notable for difficult to control tremors which caused occasional agitation. 

ACUTE ISSUES ============ #Post Cardiac Arrest #Respiratory Failure Likely a respiratory arrest secondary to mucous plugging versus possible Type I NSTEMI. Patient was cooled to 35C for 24 hours and then rewarmed with return of mental status to the ability to follow commands, although not to his baseline of being alert and interactive. As he was warmed he was monitored on EEG and intermittently displayed signs of tremor that were concerning for possible seizure activity but per evaluation on EEG were not consistent with seizure activity. At time of discharge, mental status had improved and patient was able to follow simple commands and answer simple (yes/no) questions. 

#Agitation #AMS Multifactorial, has baseline dementia with delirium from prolonged hospital/rehab courses. Now with a likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy component from cardiac arrest. Agitation was treated initially with precedex which was eventually changed to Seroquel. 

#Tremor Propranolol and Primidone restarted for tremor.

#NSTEMI Troponins elevated with peak at 0.64. Cardiology consulted, but given recent neurosurgery recommended against heparin gtt. Continued on ASA/Statin.

CHRONIC ISSUES ============== #Complicated UTI Grew MDR pseudomonas and VRE at ___ on ___, also with positive blood cultures. Was on Ceftolozane-Tazobactam on admission, transitioned to Ceftaz and Linezolid here based on micro data from Rehab to complete a 14 day course.

#___ Had ___ in ___ requiring multiple surgical interventions at ___ and ___, with most recent surgery in early ___. Given NSTEMI, neurosurgery was consulted and recommended against heparin gtt use.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Draw BCX/UCX on last day of antibiotics (___) to ensure adequate treatment given culture data suggesting intermediate response to Ceftazidime. [ ] Held amlodipine & hydralazine i/s/o hypotension. As blood pressure improves, should restart. [ ] If tremor fails to improve with propranolol & primidone, patient should be evaluated by neurology. [ ] Discharged w PICC for IV abx. [ ] Seroquel started for agitation and delirium. Given ongoing delirium, continued at time of discharge, but this should be weaned as delirium improves.
