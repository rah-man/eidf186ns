 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with venous Stasis with cellulitis. We treated you with wound care and antibiotics. When you go home it is important you take your antibiotics as prescribed and complete the course. You may bath normaly and should moisturize your skin daily. Always wear socks and shoes to protect your feet. 

If you get any new wounds, please call your PCP or ___ doctor for advice or to be seen.  

How can you care for yourself at home? Take your antibiotics as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics. 

Prop up the infected area on pillows to reduce pain and swelling. Try to keep the area above the level of your heart as often as you can. 

Keep the skin clean and dry. 

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment. Be sure to make any suggested appointments and go to all scheduled visits. Watch for signs that you are not getting better as expected, and call your doctor or other clinician if you have concerns.

To prevent cellulitis in the future 

Try to prevent cuts, scrapes, or other injuries to your skin. Cellulitis most often occurs where there is a break in the skin. 

 If you get a scrape, cut, mild burn, or bite, clean the wound with soap and water only as soon as you can to help avoid infection. Other cleaning products, such as hydrogen peroxide, can delay wound healing. 

You may cover the wound with a thin layer of antibiotic ointment, such as bacitracin, and a nonstick bandage. 

Apply more ointment and replace the bandage as needed. 

If you have swelling in your legs (edema), support stockings and good skin care may help prevent leg sores and cellulitis.
