 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with rectal bleeding. As you just had an upper endoscopy on ___ which showed a small amount of bleeding along the stomach side of the surgical connection, the GI team wanted to take another look to make sure there was no more bleeding that made its way down to your rectum. Upper endoscopy showed no bleeding. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed hemorrhoids, which is likely the source of your rectal bleeding, especially if you have been constipated. We recommend increasing the fiber and water in your diet and taking stool softeners such as docusate daily. Your other chronic conditions are stable, and we made no changes in your medications except we stopped the Celebrex, which increases your risk of bleeding. You may restart your aggrenox and aspirin tomorrow. Lastly, please follow-up with your primary care doctor for ___ chest ___, which we wanted to obtain here to evaluate why you have been coughing and short of breath intermittently for the last few months.  Followup Instructions: ___
