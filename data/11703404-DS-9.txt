Patient reports that the day prior to her falling down she was feeling very fatigued. She denied fever chills or nausea. She said she woke up at night and her head was spinning, she felt nauseous, and as she was walking to the bathroom she took 2 steps and passed out. She remarks that she was unconscious for about 10 min. and and then she woke up however she could not get any help and remained lying on the floor for approximately 10 hours.

She was treated her with, levaquin, fluid, and diuretics. 5 days prior to her presentation at ___ she reported lying in bed and her heart rate went up to 200. During that time she denied any chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Following this episode, T-wave inversions were noted on her EKG. Next, she underwent percent teen stress test which showed ___- lateral ischemia. Her troponins were negative. Upon transfer, the patient denies shortness of breath or chest pain. She denied palpitations. She notes that she has chronic back and joint pain from her PMR for which she takes prednisone daily.

MICROBIOLOGY ___ URINE URINE CULTURE-PENDING  ___ URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL  . ___: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION  1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographyically apparent obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was short with a distal 25% stenosis.  The LAD was moderately calcified with an ostial 20%, mild luminal irregularities to 20% proximall and slightly slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. There was a large D1 and likely intramuocardial mi LAD. The LCx had an ostial 35% and supplies a large branching OM1 with tortuous terminal vessels suggestive of hypertensive heart disease. The Modest caliber AV groove Cx supplies the LPL. Again there was slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. The RCA had minimal luminal irregularities with slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. The totuous rPDA and the terminal AV groove RCA, and the atrial branch arises from the mid RCA. Of note there was preferential access of the conus branch. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 6mm Hg and normal systemic systolic pressure with an sbp of 114 mm Hg. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Coronary arteries are normal. 2. Normal ventricular function.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ w/hx GAVE, recurrent UTI, morbid obesity, DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement transferred from ___ for cardiac catheterization following ___ ischemia seen on P-Mibi obtained in the setting of a syncope workup; found to have clean coronaries; post-catheterization course c/b transient ___ attributed to contrast nephropathy. . # TRANSFER FOR CATHETERIZATION AFTER POSITIVE P-MIBI Pt reported no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, PND, or orthopnea on admission or at any time during this hospitalization. Given report of positive p-MIBI, she was started on atorvastatin 40 mg, metoprolol 75 mg BID, and ASA while awaiting catheterization. Underwent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography, which demonstrated normal coronary arteries and normal left ventricular function. . # Acute-on-chronic renal failure/CONTRAST NEPHROPATHY Baseline creatinine 1.7; creatinine acutely rose to 2.4 approximately 24h after catheterization. Underlying reason for chronic renal failure unknown. Acute renal failure likely a combination of pre-renal due to poor PO intake + contrast nephropathy: urine eosinophils were positive, FeNa was 0.2. She gained 3 kg in this setting (132 -> 135 kg), predominantly equal bilateral non-tender ___ edema (lungs clear). She produced 1.5L in response to 1 dose 40 mg IV lasix & was discharged on 20 mg PO lasix QD x3 days with renal function improving, Cr 2.4->2.2. Expect full recovery of GFR to Cr baseline of 1.7 as contrast nephropathy clears over the next few days. Held metformin and lisinopril in this context. Will need follow-up creatinine check. . # HX DMII Patient has known diabetes, takes oral metformin. Because of elevated BS to the high 200s + worsening renal function, she was transitioned to an insulin sliding scale. Required a total of 40U insulin/day on ___ and ___. Discharged on 13U qHS lantus + humalog sliding scale QACHS. A1c here was 6.7%, but we note that she need to permanently transition from orals to insulin given the degree of elevation of her blood sugars. . # HX HYPERTENSION Patient takes lisinopril and verapamil at home for hypertension (see below for home doses). SBP hovered 90-100 here off antihypertensives, so her BP meds were held. Will need follow-up BP checks after lasix diuresis completes and decision re: whether to restart BP meds. Recommend rechecking serum creatinine before restarting lisinipril. . # HX DVT/PE Patient has known hx DVT/PE and is s/p IVC filter placement; not on anticoagulation chronically because of her history of GIB (related to GAVE). She was not able to tolerate pneumoboots here, so subcutaneous heparin was started. Patient was in bed throughout most of admission. She should be encouraged to ambulate and to work with ___. Will also need close monitoring for possible recurrent GI bleed. . # HX RECURRENT UTI Urine checked here; initial urine sample was treated as if positive (2 doses cipro) but subsequently re-evaluated and thought to be contaminated. Repeat UA less suggestive of infection; decision made not to continue antibiotics but to following urine culture (pending, NGTD at time of discharge). . # Hx GAVE Patient has history of gastric antral vascular ectasias (GAVE), which put her at risk of chronic low-level GI bleeding. Noted as the reason why pt is not on systemic anticoagulation despite hx DVT/PE. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. Call ___ micro lab at ___ for results of pending urine culture. 2. Needs weekly or bi-weekly Hct checks, monitoring for GI bleeding (risk of recurrent low-grade bleed w/history of GAVE. 3. Recheck Cr in 3 days (baseline 1.7; 2.2 and downtrending at discharge). 4. Monitor BP, restart BP meds if hypertensive (suggest verapamil first, then lisinopril once Cr normalizes (to baseline 1.7)). 5. Patient was started on insulin on discharge from hospital.  She should receive instruction on how to self-administer insulin prior to discharge from rehab (she already received some teaching in hospital)  Medications on Admission: 1. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

 Discharge Instructions: ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ ___. 

You were referred from ___ after a stress test that was concerning for coronary artery disease. Fortunately, your cardiac enzymes and cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of atherosclerotic heart disease. . You developed mild kidney failure after cardiac catheterization, likely from a mild allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Your kidney function was improving by the time you left the hospital and should return to normal soon. As your kidney function improves, your weight should also normalize because your kidneys will gradually excrete the extra fluid you retained. . We carefully monitored your blood counts because of your history of GI bleed. You did not have any evidence of bleeding.

HELD VERAPAMIL due to low blood pressures. This may be restarted before you go home from rehab. HELD LISINOPRIL due to kidney injury. This should be restarted before you go home from rehab.
