Micro: None

Imaging: None  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with T2DM, depression and HLD who presents with ongoing non-bloody diarrhea and inability to keep up with POs. 

#Diarrhea: Cause of diarrhea not entirely clear, but given history and benign exam, viral gastroenteritis would be most likely. Would also consider post-gastroenteritis lactose intolerance and she has been advised to avoid dairy. She had C. diff sent by her PCP prior to admission which was negative.  Metformin was decreased from 1000mg tid to ___ bid as this may exacerbate her diarrhea. She had only one loose bowel movement during this admission. She was given maintenance fluids the first night of admission. She was taking good PO at discharge and will be discharged home with services.

#T2DM: No recent A1c in our records, on long acting insulin and oral hypoglycemics at home. She did not appear to be taking her oral hypoglycemics as prescribed, she would sometimes skip meals and not take a dose of her medications or would take doses without meals. Given that she was taking above the recommended max dose of metformin which may be exacerbating her diarrhea, the dose was decreased to 1000mg bid. Would also consider switching her repaglinide to glipizide as an outpatient, although we will leave this decision to her PCP. As an inpatient, her oral hypoglycemics were held and she was covered with a Humalog sliding scale.

#Depression: Continued home mirtazipine.

#Anemia: Hct close to recent baseline, no evidence of bleeding on exam and stools are non-bloody. Hct trended down slightly after IV fluids which was not unexpected. Can have repeat CBC checked as an outpatient.

#HLD: Continued on pravastatin.

#Osteopenia/osteoporosis: Continued on Ca/VitD and alendronate.  #Code status this admission: FULL (confirmed) 

#Transitional issues: -Metformin decreased from 1000mg tid to bid at discharge -Encouraged to take large amount of PO fluids while having loose stools -C. diff was negative and she was advised she may take Immodium -Advised to avoid dairy foods as this may exacerbate her diarrhea -Would consider changing repaglinide to glipizide as an outpatient  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
