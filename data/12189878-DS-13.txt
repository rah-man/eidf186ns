IMAGING/REPORTS: ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF=55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Atrial rhythm appears to be atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter. Prominent anterior fat pad. No pericardial effusion seen.

T/C SPINE XRAY ___: C1-C6 visualized on the lateral projection. Bones appear demineralized.  There is mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5. No fracture seen.  No prevertebral soft tissue swelling.   Thoracic spine: Bones appear diffusely demineralized, limiting sensitivity for detecting acute fracture. No definite fracture seen. There is moderate cardiomegaly with evidence of left atrial enlargement. Calcification in the aortic arch noted. 

CT HEAD ___: No acute findings. Probable chronic lacunar infarct in left thalamus. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Brain parenchymal atrophy 

CXR ___: Enlarged cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pulmonary edema.

She presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
