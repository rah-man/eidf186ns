IMAGING CT HEAD: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction. Slight prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with age-related involutional change. Bilateral calcifications of the carotid siphons are noted. Aside from minimal ethmoidal air cell mucosal thickening, the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

CXR: FINDINGS: The lungs are clear with no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No effusion or pneumothorax is present. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Minimal nonspecific reticular opacities are again present, predominantly in the right mid and left lower lung regions. Previously seen calcified lymph nodes in the lower right paratracheal region are again present. Soft tissue density at the right paratracheal stripe is unchanged.   IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

MR ___ IMPRESSION: Somewhat motion-limited examination, with: 1. No finding to specifically suggest the vertebral osteomyelitis-discitis-epidural phlegmon complex. 2. Normal cervical spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity. 3. Relatively thin retropharyngeal/prevertebral effusion, not clearly present on the ___ CT. Such findings may be seen with acute calcific tendinitis of the longus ___ muscles, which may have this clinical presentation. Though this entity is usually associated with characteristic punctate calcifications, immediately anterior to the C1-C2 level (at this tendon attachment), these are not definitely seen on the CT study.   COMMENT: Preliminary interpretation of "no epidural abscess. Moderate multilevel DJD with canal and neural foraminal narrowing at C3-4, C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7" was discussed with a Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ telephone, on ___.   Given the difference with that reading, the final findings were discussed with Dr. ___ (the patient's primary houseofficer) by Dr. ___ telephone ___, ___. 

Repeat CXR Moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration is stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is patchy opacity at the right lung base. Left retrocardiac atelectasis is resolving.   IMPRESSION: Vague opacity at the right lung base may represent a developing pneumonic infiltrate. 

JOINT FLUID ___ 09:55AM JOINT FLUID ___ RBC-1500* Polys-87* ___ ___ 09:55AM JOINT FLUID Crystal-FEW Shape-RHOMBOID Locatio-INTRAC Birefri-POS Comment-c/w calcium pyrophosphate crystals  Brief Hospital Course: ___ M with h/o prostate CA admitted with headache, fever, and neck pain concerning for meningitis however no CSF pleocytosis.  Imaging revealed Acute Calcific Retropharyngeal Tendinitis which was treated with NSAIDs. One day later, the patient developed right knee warm effusion. Rheumatology consulted and performed arthrocentesis. Fluid analysis revealed calcium pyrophosphate crystals consistent with pseudogout.

# Fever, headache, neck pain: LP reassuring, and imaging seems to indicate acute calcific retropharyngeal tendonitis. Fever and leukocytosis can actually be part of the typical presentation of this syndrome, however would still consider other causes. Notably, CXR seems to show possible PNA (see below). Other causes of his neck pain were also considered, but overall acute infectious processes were ruled out and he was treated for the possible acute calcific retropharyngeal tendonitis. A lyme serology was sent which will need to be followed up. He received tylenol, oxycodone, and received the most relief from NSAIDs while in house. Blood and urine cxs (as well as CSF cxs) were sent which were negative (gram stain negative), however final report is pending at time of discharge. No abx were originally started except for levoflox (see below) for PNA. 

# Knee pain: Developed on HD2. Rheum was consulted and concern was for psuedogout given calcium hydroxyapatite deposition as the cause of acute calcific retropharyngeal tendonitis, and perhaps a similar pathophysiology between the two processes. As per rheumatology c/s, we sent for PTH, thyroid fx and iron studies to look for secondary causes of perhaps hypercalcemia to account for these findings. Of note, calcium was wnl in house.  The results of these tests should be f/u as an outpatient, and the patient was asked to f/u with rheumatology in ___ weeks after discharge. Arthrocentesis was performed and was c/w pseudogout. We continued his treatment (NSAIDs) and held off on steroids. He was clinically improving at time of discharge, much helped by the fluid removal from arthrocentesis. Pt may also require ___ x-ray to be done as outpt.

# fever and leukocytosis with transient hypoxia: CXR with possible PNA. Given his fever and leukocytosis seem more severe than what would be expected from his neck pathology and knee pathology, we preferred to treat with a short course of abx ( 5 days of levoflox 750 mg total).

# Hyperglycemia: On labs in ED without history of DM. Unclear if taken through vein that was getting D51/2NS or whether patient has undiagnosed DM. Repeat BS was okay, and A1c was 5.9%. FSBS was d/c'ed as random BG in house were wnl.  # Prostate and bladder CA:  - F/u as outpatient. Not an acute issue.  # Hyperlipidemia - Continued statin (simva 40)  # Prevention:  - ASA, Vit C per home regimen, MVI, Calcium-Vit D continued
