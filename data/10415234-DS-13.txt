UA clear

CXR: No acute intrathoracic process. 

CT head: There is a new 7 mm hypodensity seen in the right thalamus consistent with lacunar infarct which could be acute or subacute. Otherwise, there is preservation of white-gray matter differentiation. There is generalized atrophy and prominence of the ventricles consistent with normal age-related volume loss. There is mild sinus disease seen in the ethmoid air cells. The mastoid air cells and EAC are clear. There are no fractures or soft tissue abnormalities.   IMPRESSION: Acute or subacute right thalamic lacunar infarct. 

MRI/MRA: Right thalamic restricted diffusion new from ___ MR; however, similar to CT head ___. Central focal susceptability concerning for central blood products (5:12). No shift of midline structures.

Both middle cerebral arteries are poorly visualized which appears artifactual but no occlusion is seen. Stenosis in the middle cerebral arteries cannot be excluded. 

Transthoracic echo: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.  

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurology serivce on ___t home with some left-sided sensory changes. Upon arrival he was noted to have weakness in his left arm and leg. A CT head showed acute R thalamic infarct. He was changed from aspirin to plavic. MRI showed restricted diffusion in R thalamus with small amount of hemorrhagic conversion; MRA showed no significant stenosis, however the MCA's were poorly visualized bilaterally. Echocardiogram showed mild LVH, hypokinesis of several segments with EF 40-45% and no cardiac source of embolus.

He was maintained on telemetry monitoring. His antihypertensives were held with the exception of Imdur to allow for autoregulation. His home antihypertensives were restarted upon discharge.

He remained afebrile with no signs of infection. His home metformin and glyburide were held and he was maintained on ISS during his admission.
