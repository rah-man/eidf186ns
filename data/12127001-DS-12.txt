IMAGING: ___: CT HEAD Interval decrease in size of a small left subdural hematoma causing only minimal residual rightward shift of the typically midline structures. No new hemorrhage identified. 

___: LENIS 1. Occlusive or nearly-occlusive deep venous thrombus in the LEFT CFV, extending to the proximal superficial and deep femoral veins.  Given its similar location compared to ___, it is not possible to determine whether this represents residual thrombus or acute clot. 2. No deep venous thrombus in the right lower extremity veins. 

___: CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1. Evolution of left subdural hematoma. 2. No evidence of new hemorrhage. 3. Stable minimal rightward midline shift. 4. Stable left occipital subgaleal hematoma. 5. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # s/p Fall with Acute on Chronic Subdural Hematoma: Mr. ___ was admitted to ___ on ___ for close neurological monitoring. His INR was reversed in the ED. Repeat imaging demonstrated interval improvement of the SDH. He remained at his neurologic baseline per outpatient providers. Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis. He was mobilized with ___ who recommended rehabilitation at discharge. 

# DVT previously on Coumadin: Anticoagulation had been started in ___ and continued since. ___ ultrasound was performed here with chronic clot in the LLE; this was reviewed by Vascular Surgery who believed the patient did not require ongoing systemic anticoagulation or IVC filter based on the chronic nature of the clot. Coumadin was discontinued here and on discharge. 

# History of Dementia / UTI: Patient with waxing/waning medical status, from oriented x3 to intermittent confusion. Outpatient baseline is that he is slow to respond to questions, and will sometimes voluntarily not respond to questioning. Other contributors could include legal blindness (reportedly 90% blind in both eyes), possible UTI (patient admitted on Cipro started prior to admission, outpatient culture was growing 10K colonies each of three organisms, thought commensal flora, so this medication was stopped; for +yeast urine culture here x2, Geriatrics started diflucan to complete a 14 day course), and outpatient benzodiazepines (though these were continued so as not to precipitate withdrawal). TSH, B12 and Folate were all within normal limits.
