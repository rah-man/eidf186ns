Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo man with a history of GERD, untreated hypertension, active tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and probable hyperlipidemia who presented to ___ with shortness of breath. He was intubated in their ED and was found to have an anterior wall STEMI with 100% ostial LAD occlusion, s/p successful reperfusion with aspiration thrombectomy and a DES on ___, complicated by periprocedural hypotension indicative of cardiogenic shock necessitating balloon pump and pressors, transferred to ___ for further management. He was successfully extubated on ___, weaned off pressors, and weaned off the balloon pump in the CCU. He was stable for transfer to the cardiology step-down unit on ___ with a hospital course notable for a uncomplicated catheter-associated bloodstream infection with Staph epidermidis treated with Vancomycin for 5 days. He was also found to have myositis of his right calf, possibly due to acute statin therapy.

# Acute coronary syndrome/CAD: Anterior STEMI with 100% ostial LAD occlusion s/p successful reperfusion with aspiration thrombectomy and one DES, with residual 70-80% stenosis LCx (no intervention) and 100% chronically occluded RCA. Primary PCi at ___ was complicated by periprocedural hypotension and cardiogenic shock necessitating balloon pump and pressors.

First cleared blood culture on ___. CVL and IABP were promptly removed after positive culture data on ___. Patient treated from ___ for 5 day course of vancomycin.

# Myositis of the right calf, likely statin related: Patient found to have myositis of right calf after initiation of statin. There were no other clear triggers, with peak total CK 363, downtrending prior to discharge off statin. Orthopedic was consulted, with no concern for compartment syndrome. CT imaging consistent with intramuscular edema of posterior calf. Calf pain improved prior to discharge. Statin discontinued. Although the patient's catheterization site was right femoral, it is unlikely that his calf pain was related to his cardiac catheterization or subsequent IABP; ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT or ___ cyst, and the calf lesion was not contiguous with his femoral arteriotomy site.

# Transaminitis: Patient with mildly elevated LFTs on admission. Etiology likely multifactorial given his history alcohol abuse and liver imaging showing echogenic liver consistent with steatosis, myocardial necrosis and possible congestive hepatopathy from STEMI, and statin induced myositis of the right calf. Hepatitis serologies were negative and liver enzymes downtrending upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,  It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ ___. You were admitted because you had a heart attack. It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. Very importantly, you are now taking aspirin and ticagrelor. These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents, and you may die from a massive heart attack. Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications.

You were found to have an infection in your blood stream that was treated with antibiotics. This was an infection likely caused by the emergent catheters you had to received in the intensive care unit so you could receive medications to help you recover from your heart attack. 

Unfortunately you had a bad reaction to atorvastatin (Lipitor) and you had muscle inflammation of your right calf. We had to stop the atorvastatin. This "statin" medication is important to keep your heart healthy so in the future, your cardiologist or primary care physician may try another statin-type of medication in the future.

Please STOP SMOKING. Smoking is a MAJOR RISK FACTOR for a heart attack. 

At discharge, you weighed 185.6 lbs. Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert them to this change. 

THESE ARE YOUR HEART MEDICATIONS TO TAKE DAILY: Aspirin 81 mg DAILY Lisinopril 2.5 mg DAILY Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg DAILY TiCAGRELOR 90 mg PO/NG TWICE PER DAY

If you have pain, avoid advil/motrin/aleve. Do not take more than 81mg of aspirin per day. You can take acetaminophen (tylenol) but avoid more than 3000mg per day. 

We wish you the best with your health, 

Your ___ Cardiac Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
