A CT spine was obtained and the read showed no fracture, and her C-spine was cleared. Approximately 12 hours later, a nurse observed the patient to be extremely unsteady on her feet, somewhat tremulous, and not as easily conversant as prior. A second CT head was obtained and was negative for edema or new subdural. The patient was observed overnight on fall precautions and there were no further events, and her mental status was at baseline. The attending radiologist later re-read the C-spine study and notified the team that there was possible cervical cord compression. . # Cervical Cord compression w/o radiculopathy: Possible C6-C7 cord compression based on CT cervical spine. No associated neurologic deficits. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended myelogram for further assessment. The family and patient chose not to have the CT myelogram done.

Neurosurgery team confirmed this was in fact the case.
