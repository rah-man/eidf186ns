Chief Complaint: Right gaze deviation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None

 History of Present Illness: ___ year-old right-handed woman with a PMH significant for HTN, orthostatic hypotension, HLD and likely right parietal stroke (per medical record) in ___ s/p R CEA who presents after a 2 minute episode of right gaze deviation. She lives at ___ on the ___ long-term care facility and says that she felt lightheaded upon awakening at 8:30 AM. She notes eating breakfast-coffee and toast and that she developed blurry vision around this time- 9AM. She says that she had no double vision, vertigo, speech difficulties, sensory changes or weakness on top of her baseline left hand weakness, which she says is residual from her prior stroke. The doctor at the facility was called in and the patient herself was unable to provide any information about what subsequently happened except that her vision has since improved; she denies ever losing consciosuness.  Upon speaking to the doctor ar the facility, her BP was elevated last night to 220 systolic and this morning she noted dizziness and difficulty focusing her eyes. The doctor then went in to evaluate her-she had her stand up and her BP dropped from 130 to 97 systolic. She turned pale with standing and while standing, around 11 AM she developed right gaze deviation. She was able to follow other commands, but was unable to have her eyes get to or cross midline. She was reported as saying she could not see at this time. Her speech was noted as being clear. She was laid back down in bed, with initial persistance of the eye deviation, but this then resolved in about 2 minutes after onset. Remained to be able to follow commands. No tongue biting or incontinence reported. EMS was called and patient brought to hospital. She says that she is now back to her baseline.   Neuro ROS: Positive for lightheadedness, blurry vision and the gaze deviation noted above. She also notes a daily dull frontal headache. Has history of vertigo, but last episode was ___ year ago. No diplopia, dysphagia, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No current dysarthria, though she says she may have had a brief episode of slurred speech last week, she is unable to further elaborate on this. No difficulties producing or comprehending speech. Old left hand weakness/clumsiness from prior stroke, but no new weakness. No numbness or parasthesias. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. No difficulty with gait.  General ROS: Positive for constipation. No fever or chills. No cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.

  URINE CULTURE (Final ___:  <10,000 organisms/ml. . . Radiology: CTA HEAD/NECK W&W/OC & RECONSStudy Date of ___ 12:31 ___ IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality with moderate atrophy, particularly left more than right frontal cortical, and progressive sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease since the ___ study. 2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aortic arch and great vessels; this most significantly involves the left common carotid artery at its origin, as well as that carotid bulb with high-grade, likely at least 75% stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which appears to have progressed since the carotid duplex sonogram of ___. There is no tandem stenosis or flow-limiting stenosis involving the contralateral internal carotid or the vertebral arteries. 3. Moderate stenosis involving the proximal P2 segment of the left PCA with no other significant stenosis involving the intracranial vasculature. 4. Incidental findings, as above. Given the background of severe emphysema, the findings involving the left upper lobe might be further evaluated by direct comparison with the dedicated chest CT of ___ (not currently available), which raised the possibility of chronic infection with organisms such as ___. . MR HEAD W/O CONTRASTStudy Date of ___ 4:33 ___ IMPRESSION:   1. A very tiny focus of decreased diffusion in the right occipital lobe, in the periventricular location likely in/adjacent to the right optic radiation measuring approximately 2 mm. This represents an acute infarct. No associated hemorrhage or surrounding mass effect on the present study. D/w ___ by ___ on ___ at approx. 8.30pm.   2. Progression of the extensive white matter changes in the cerebral white matter and in the pons, nonspecific in appearance, likely related to small vessel ischemic changes.   3. Moderate dilation of the lateral and the third ventricles, which may relate to parenchymal volume loss; to correlate clinically for superimposed communicating hydrocephalus such as NPH. Significant frontal lobe atrophy, with prominence of the sulci and extra-axial CSF spaces seen on the prior study of ___, progressed compared to the prior study of ___. Please see other details on concurrent CT angiogram of the head and neck.   4. Paranasal sinus disease involving the left maxillary sinus and the mastoid air cells as described above to a mild extent. . CHEST (PA & LAT)Study Date of ___ 2:36 ___ IMPRESSION:   Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Aorta is somewhat calcified and tortuous consistent with atherosclerosis. Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or aspiration. No evidence of pulmonary edema. A small 4-mm nodule in the right apex and vague linear opacities in the left upper lobe peripherally are unchanged on comparison to chest films from ___ and correlated with the chest CT from ___. . . Cardiology: TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 1:40:32 ___ Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Aortic valve sclerosis. Dilated ascending aorta. Pulmonary artery hypertension. No definite cardiac source of embolism identifed. . ECG Study Date of ___ 12:50:26 ___    Sinus rhythm. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no significant change.  TRACING #1    Read by: ___.   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 65 144 86 426/434 70 55 79 . ECG Study Date of ___ 7:45:08 AM    Sinus rhythm. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave flattening.

Neurophysiology: EEG Study Date of ___ IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG. The diffuse attenuation of background could be a normal variant or could be related to medication effect. There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old right-handed woman with a PMH significant for HTN, orthostatic hypotension, HLD and likely right parietal stroke (per medical record) in ___ s/p R CEA who presents after a 2 minute episode of right gaze deviation occurring in the setting of orthostatic BP drop with standing. This was felt likely to be a seizure in the setting of hypotension and subsequent stroke as MRI showed a small right occipital infarct. Etiology is possibly embolic given distribution but there was no evidence of a cardiac cause on echo but there was diffuse disease on her CTA. She had no further episodes and EEG was normal suggesting low risk for further seizures. Medications were optimised with aspirin dose increase, statin dose increase and started on low dose amlodipine. She should be seen by her home's PCP and has neurology follow-up. . # Neurology: Patient has risk factors of HTN, orthostatic hypotension, HLD, previous CEA and previous stroke. Patient presented with fixed right gaze deviation (sparing consciousness) in the setting of significant orthostatic hypotension. On examination, she had some mild left hand weakness with corresponding clumsiness with no other focal neurological deficits.  CT-A showed moderate atrophy and significant small vessel disease in addition to extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aortic arch and great vessels> This was most significant in the left common carotid artery at its origin, as well as that carotid bulb with high-grade, likely at least 75% stenosis of the proximal left ICA and moderate stenosis involving the left PCA.  MRI head showed a very small infarct in the right occipital lobe.  Echo showed mild LVH with EF >70%, mild MR, very slight dilated ascending aorta at 3.5cm, mild pulmonary HTN and no definite cardiac source of embolism identified.  It seems likely that the patient had a seizure in the setting of hypotension and latterly had a stroke. Patient had no further episodes in house and EEG was completely normal with no evidence of seizure activity suggesting low risk for further seizures. Given the location of her stroke, the most likely etiology is embolic. Risk factors were addressed and fasting lipid showed Chol 180 LDL 103 and HbA1c was 6.0%. Telemetry revealed atrial ectopics and no evidence of AF. Medications were optimised with aspirin increased to 325mg, pravastatin dose was increased to 80mg daily and started on low dose amlodipine 2.5mg daily which she had been on. PCP to watch for orthostatic hypotension given previous problems. Patient was discharged back to her nursing home on ___. Patient has neurology follow-up on ___. .  # ___: Echo showed mild LVH with EF >70%, mild MR, very slight dilated ascending aorta at 3.5cm, mild pulmonary HTN and no definite cardiac source of embolism identified.  Patient's BP was stable in house and aspirin was increased to 325mg and pravastatin was increased to 80mg. PCP to watch for orthostatic hypotension given previous problems and orthostatic hypotension. .  # ID: UTI with UA showed RBC 64 WBC 24 moderate LeukE and bacteria and urine culture showed no growth. Patient was started on ciprofloxacin for 3 days and stopped on ___. .  # Incidental finding on CT: CTA had some lung imaged and revealed relatively severe panlobular emphysema, with nodular-appearing scarring involving the anterolateral aspect of the left lung apex and patchy ground-glass opacity abutting that oblique fissure, incompletely imaged. They therefore suggested possible follow-up with a dedicated chest CT as previous imaging had suggested possible chronic ___.

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Small right occipital lobe infract possibly due to embolism Likely seizure in setting of stroke and hypotension . Secondary diagnoses: Urinary tract infection

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).

 Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the ___. You presented after your gaze was fixed to the right but were conscious in the context of an abrupt blood pressure drop while you were also noting some vision problems. You were taken to the ___ for evaluation and seen by neurology in the emergency department. You had a CT scan of your head which showed old changes and a CT of the arteries of the head and neck which showed narrowing of multiple arteries. You were admitted under neurology. You had an MRI which showed a very small stroke involving the right side of your brain. You also had an EEG (brain wave test) to look for any abnormal brain wave changes or seizures and this was NORMAL whcih means taht it is unlikley you will have a further seizure. It was felt that in the context of your blood pressure drop that you had a small seizure and at the same time had a very small stroke. To investigate where this may have come from, you had an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) which did not show any worrying changes. You also had evidence of a urinary infection and were treated with an antiobiotic called ciprofloxacin for 3 days. You were discharged home on an increased aspirin dose and an increased pravastatin dose (to aid in lowering cholesterol) and added back your amlodipine for better blood pressure control. These medications will all reduced the risk of having further strokes. You have neurology follow-up as below. . Medication changes: We STARTED amlodipine 2.5mg daily for your blood pressure We INCREASED aspirin to 325mg daily We INCREASED pravastatin to 80mg daily  Followup Instructions: ___
