CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 1:12 ___ IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. 

 Brief Hospital Course: 1. Syncope - There appears to be 2 seperate events, which include the presyncopal event and the orthostasis. They may be related, but the syncopal event has a broader differential even if the patient was dehydrated. - Given her remembering the event, a generalized seizure is unlikely, and there is no evidence of a post-ictal state. The time course is also improbable for a seizure - While the patient has CAD, there is no concern for a cardiac event given her initial enzymes were flat. Her EKG in the ED and on the floor are normal sinus rhythm with no ST changes. Most tachy-arrythmias that cause syncope would be unlikely to be spontaneously recovered from. A brady arrthymia is possible but we have no evidence from telemtry that the patient has this, even when feeling unwell on the ward. - Most likely is a vasovagal event. - While she does not have carotid bruits on exam, her head was extended when she had the presyncope in the hairdressers chiar. That being said, there is no indication of an acute event, so her carotids can be imaged by her PCP. We will give her the order for follow up with her PCP/Cardiologist here. - Telemetry 

2. Orthostatic Hypotension - patient was hypotensive on the floor, even in the setting of not taking all of her blood pressure medications today and eating and drinking without history of fluid loss.She responded well to fluids originally. On the day of discharge she was not orthostatic. This will need to be rechecked by her PCP after discharge. - She recieved 500cc bolus of NS over 30min  - Rechecked orthostatics 

3. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus Controlled without complications - patient's last A1c= 7.1 on metformin and repaglinide.  - Hold metformin and repaglinide, ISS

4. Pancytopenia - Hematocrit is stable. - Unclear why WBC dropped so much. She has been that low before many years ago, and this is from the low end of normal. Patient should have repeat CBC the week of ___. - She has a heme-onc physician here, who can follow this up as well - No sign of acute bleed leading to the hypotension 

5. Benign Hypertension, CAD native Vessle - Continue metoprolol tartate 25mg po Daily  - Holding isosorbide mononitrate on evening of admission - Hold lisinopril pending improvement in her BPs  - continue aspirin, simvistatin

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to the hospital after you had an episode of syncope (passing out). We ruled out a heart attack as the cause, and you did not have any signs of irregular heart rhythm while in the hospital. You were a little dehydrated and seemed to feel dizzy when your blood pressure was low so we gave you some fluids and held some of your blood pressure medicines while you were here and your blood pressure improved and your symptoms improved. You did not have any signs of having had a stroke, or having infections when we examined you, tested your urine and looked at your chest xray. The cause of your dehydration may have been that you had lots of sugar in your urine, which can cause you to loose more water than you are taking in. We would like to perform a carotid doppler ultrasound (ultrasound of the large vessels in your neck) to make sure it is not due to some blockage of these arteries. You will be given the order and need to schedule the appointment when you get home, your primary care doctor and cardiologist should help follow up these studies. During your hospital stay we also noticed that you had a low white blood cell count which you have had in the past. You had no signs of any infections. This should be followed-up by a blood count draw by your primary care doctor later this week. 

No changes were made to your medications

Outstanding issues: -You need to schedule a carotid duplex ultrasound (see order we gave to you for the number) -Have your blood counts (CBC) checked by your PCP later this week
