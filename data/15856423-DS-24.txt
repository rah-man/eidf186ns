PERTINENT STUDIES ECHO ___ The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) with regional variation. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. . Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced and the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are significantly increased.  . # ECHO ___ There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. . IMPRESSION: Moderate calcific aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitaiton. Mild to moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. . Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, aortic transvalvular gradients have decreased. Aortic regurgitation remains in the mild range. LV systolic function has slightly improved.  . CARDIAC CATH FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Severe aortic stenosis 2. SEvere mitral regurgitation 3. Borderline cardiac index 4. Successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty with 20mm Tyshak II balloon (2 inflations) without complication 5. Please see note in OMR for full details of RHC and valvuloplasty procedure.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F with critical AS, CAD s/p CABG presented with increased DOE and volume overload. . ACTIVE ISSUES # Aortic stenosis Pt has significant aortic stenosis incduced cardiomyopathy. Her presenting exam was notable for significant both right and left heart failure, with significant pulmonary edema causing respiratory distress. Pt was treated with lasix gtt, which she tolerated well with daily negative ___ liters. Her pulmonary edema was further treated with left side thoracentesis with pigtail drainage. Approximately 2L serous fluid were drained in 24 hours. Afterwards, pt underwent a left sided catheterization with valvuloplasty, with improvement of mean aortic valve gradient by ~50%. However, pt was also found to have worsening of her dialated cardiomyopathy as well as MR, TR. Because of these reasons, pt was found not a candidate for TAVI/COREVALE.  We started her on torsemide 40 mg daily, and her IN/OUTs have been stable on this regimen. Of note, pt's admission weight was 55 kg, her discharge weight was 50 kg, her lowest weight during this admission was 47 kg. . # CAD: Pt has CAD s/p CABG ___ years ago. Recent Cath in ___ showed patent grafts. Her EKG was negative and cardiac enzymes were negative. We continued her aspirin 81 mg qd. .  # Atrial fibrillation: Pt had atrial fibrillation after valvulaplasty in ___ and was started on amiodarone and coumadin.  Her coumadin was d/c'ed in ___ given she was already in sinus and the afib was likely a post-cath event. We also discontinued her amiodarone during this admission. . # Volume contraction alkalosis: Pt presented with elevated bicarbonate, which worsened with active diuresis. She was treated temporarily was acetozalomide and her bicarb improved to 39 on the day of discharge.  . # Decubitus ulcer: Pt has a new stage 1 decubitus ulcer over the sacrum. The ulcer was treated with standard wound care and no complication was observed.  . CHRONIC ISSUES # DM2: Pt has documented type 2 diabetes, and takes metformin at home. We held oral meds and started sliding scale insulin. .  # Hypothyroidism: cont'ed levothyroxine 75 mcg qd .  # HLD: cont'ed simvastatin 40 qd .  # GERD: cont'ed zofran q6 prn . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # GOAL OF CARE: As pt is no longer a candidate for either surgical management or ___ for her critical aortic stenosis, discussion around goal of care was raised among patient, her family as well as primary care team, her cardiologist Dr. ___ team and palliative care team. Going home with hospice care was decision that patient and her family choose. We arranged hospice service and made medication changes accordingly after that. # CODE: DNR/DNI (confirmed with HCP) # CONTACT: ___ (daughter, HCP) ___ ; ___ (C) # PENDING STUDIES AT DISCHARGE: None # MEDICATION CHANGES:  - DISCONTINUE simvastatin, alendronate, amiodarone, ranitidine, furosemide  - CONTINUE aspirin, levothyroxine, zofran prn, ferrous sulfate (per family request), trazadone, metformin  - START Torsemide 50 mg qd  - START miralax prn for constipation  - START morphine ___ mg sl prn for pain  - START lorazepam 0.5-1 mg q6h for anxiety / insomnia # FOLLOWUP PLAN  - Pt will go home with hospice  - Dr. ___ continue to be the primary care physician while pt is on hospice  - Will replete potassium as needed as pt is on torsemide  - Pt has a foley, which should be discontinued after arriving home  - Pt has a decubitous ulcer over the sacrum, that requires wound care  Medications on Admission: - simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY  (Daily).  - alendronate 70 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a week:  give on ___.  - metformin 850 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day:  give after lunch.  - levothyroxine 75 mcg qd  - amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime:  - multivitamin Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  - cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Tablet Sig: One (1)  Tablet PO at bedtime.  - aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable  PO DAILY (Daily).  - ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at  bedtime.  - furosemide 100 mg po qAM (started ___  Please start once diarrhea is resolved.  - tylenol ___ mg q4h prn pain/fever  - zofran 4 mg po q6h prn nausea  - duoneb HHN q4h prn for SOB  - artificial tears 1 drop to each eye bid  - ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1)  Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): after lunch and dinner.  - docusate sodium 100 mg bid prn  - bisacodyl 10 mg suppos PR prn constipation  - MOM 30 ml prn constipation  - maalox 30 ml q8h prn nausea  - trazadone 12.5 mg qhs  - NOT on NS med list, on d/c summary ___: lisinopril 2.5 mg qd
