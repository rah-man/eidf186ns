STUDIES: ___ TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion. . ___ CT Head: No acute intracranial process, including no evidence of abnormally enhancing lesion. . ___ CT Abd/pelv: 1. No evidence of intraabdominal abscess.  2. Lytic lesion in the posterior right iliac bone. This is concerning for neoplasm or infection.  3. Sclerotic lesion in the left iliac bone, possibly bone island. Suggest correlation with any history of primary malignancy. . ___ XR c-spine: Two radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrate the patient to be status post anterior and posterior C4-C7 cervical fusion. The fixation construct is similar to that seen on the intraoperative views of ___. 1 mm of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 may simply be positional. C1-C2 relationship is maintained. A central line projects over the right hemithorax. Lung apices are otherwise unremarkable. Mild prominence of the prevertebral soft tissues can be an expected postoperative finding. 

 Brief Hospital Course: 1. Cervical discitis: Upon transfer to the ___ after being found to have a suggestion of infection and spondylodiscitis affecting the area of C4-C7, the patient was taken to the operating room on ___ ___ for C5-C6 discitis where he performed at C5 corpectomy, C6 corpectomy, interbody mechanical reconstruction C4-C7, anterior arthrodesis C5-C6, anterior arthrodesis C6-C7, anterior plate instrumentation, and anterior cervical biopsies including multiple bone and disc and culture swabs. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was taken back to the operating room on ___, for posterior cervical laminotomy bilateral C7, posterior cervical instrument C4, C5, C6, and C7, posterior cervical fusion C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7, and iliac crest autograft harvest fusion augmentation, with material derived from the right posterior iliac crest. The second procedure essentially created a spinal fusion for additional support. The patient also tolerated that procedure well.

Cultures from the tissue derived from the operating room grew Streptococcus viridans. This was likely the same organism that grew from blood cultures drawn at ___ on ___, which also grew alpha hemolytic Strep, but was initially defined as Streptococcus ___, felt by our ID service to be a misidentification given that that is rarely a pathogen and is in the same family as the viridans.

The patient was empirically started on vancomycin at the ___ on ___ and switched to ceftriaxone once sensitivities returned with a planned six-week course of therapy. The infectious disease service was involved in her care.

2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's bacteremia with a endocarditis producing organism, with peripheral dissemination patient was considered to have a subacute bacterial endocarditis as the underlying etiology of her illness. She had a transthoracic echocardiogram, which did not reveal any valvular vegetation, but which has suboptimal views of the aortic valve. She was treated with ceftriaxone as described above.

3. Mild aortic stenosis: As part of the patient's preop evaluation, she underwent echocardiography for a murmur on ___. She was found to have a normal ejection fraction, unclear number of aortic valve leaflets, and a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic stenosis. She had minimally thickened mitral valve leaflets with an elevated flow pattern consistent with impaired relaxation. This was of suboptimal image quality with poor parasternal views. Diastolic dysfunction was suggested.

4. Hypertension: The patient was continued on her outpatient medications. She was normotensive during the admission.

5. Mild obstructive sleep apnea: The patient is well on room air and given that she does not use CPAP at home CPAP was not initiated during this hospitalization.

6. GERD: She can just continue on her Prilosec.

7. Constipation: The patient had probably due to her pain medications. She was prescribed an increasing number of bowel regimens including Colace, Senna, and polyethylene glycol. She defected prior to discharge.

8. Right posterior iliac lytic lesion: As part of a workup for causes of the viridans bacteremia, the patient underwent a CT scan with oral and intravenous contrasts of her abdomen and pelvis. This scan showed a lytic lesion concerning for metastasis per radiologist in the right posterior iliac fossa. However, this is the area where the bone graft was obtained the day prior in the operating room and likely represented post-surgical changes and this was confirmed with documentation by the orthopedic surgeon. An SPEP and UPEP were obtained just for the consideration of a myelomatous process, which were not consistant with multiple myeloma. Because this was at the same site of the surgery and the surgical changes could account for these findings, it was not felt that this represented a malignancy per se. A CT, MRI, or bone scan could be considered in the outpatient setting to follow this finding. . The patient underwent CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, which showed no infectious focus or abscess. The patient underwent CT scanning of the brain with contrast, which showed no embolic foci. She had surveillance blood cultures from ___, and ___, which showed no growth to date at the time of discharge. . The patient was a full code during this admission.
