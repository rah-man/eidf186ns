Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending: ___  Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right heart cath with cardiac biopsy on ___  History of Present Illness: Mr ___ is a ___ male with history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF ___, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency initially admitted to the FICU due to concern for ___ transferred to the CCU for management of CHF. . Per report patient was sent in from the nursing home due to "abnormal labs" though had no focal complaints. He had been recently discharged from ___ on ___ with the diagnosis of DVT/PE, LLE cellulitis and PNA. He was continued on warfarin (once INR was not supratherapitic) and treated with doxycycline and levofloxacin with planned 10 day course to be completed on ___ for the LLE cellulitis and PNA respectivly. Patient was sent from the nursing home because of "abnormal labs." No further history able to be obtained. Patient believes he is here because of pain in the leg. Overall says he feels OK, with main concern being leg pain in the left lower extremity. Says breathing is "good." Denies dyspnea, cough, productive cough, wheezing, pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills, abdominal pain, dysuria. . In the ED, initial VS were: 97.4 ___ 20 98%. Labs were notable for WBC 22.3, creatinine of 5.0 up from baseline 2.5-3.1; glucose of 42 (received 2 amp of dextrose), INR of 4.1, despite not having taken coumadin in a week per report. Patient was started on vanc/cefepime due to concern for evolving sepsis vs pulmonary embolus given recent peroneal vein DVT/presumed PE. (though baseline SBP in 80-90's) CTA was held because of impaired renal function. A Right IJ central line was obtained along with two peripherals. Prior to transfer blood pressures remained in ___ and Norepinephrine was started for pressure support. . In the FICU there was concern for septic shock and he was started on levophed, gental hydration, and placed on vanco/cefepime. His WBC remained constant in low 20's. He was changed to vanco/zosyn and his WBC trended down. His initial central venous sat was 70 increasing concern for sepsis. He was evaluated for infection source and his abd U/S and oral con CT were non-diagnostic. His CXR was concerning for a PNA, worsening over previous studies. Over his 3 day stay in the FICU his CO/CI worsened and his central venous sat decreaased to the 40's increasing concern for cardiogenic shock. His MAPs were low and his pressor was transitioned from levophed to doputamine without improvement. At this point he was transfered to the CCU for further evaulation and treatment.

ABX XR ___: Single frontal image of the abdomen shows nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction. There is no pneumatosis or free gas. There are numerous seeds in the prostate unchanged since the most recent. CT of the abdomen and pelvis. There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of bowel obstruction. . ABD U/S ___:  1. Cholelithiasis and sludge without sonographic evidence of acute cholecystitis.  2. Pulsatile portal vein and distended hepatic veins most likely related to right heart failure.  . CXR ___:  Considerable consolidation has developed at both lung bases in the absence of edema or even much vascular engorgement in the upper lungs, and therefore could be considered pneumonia rather than asymmetric edema. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Right internal jugular line ends centrally.  . HIDA ___:  Abnormal hepatobiliary study. Delayed uptake compatible with  hepatic dysfunction. There is initial gallbladder visualization indicating no acute cholecystitis. The gallbladder does not respond to a CCK analog (sincalide) indicating gallbladder dysfunction.  . CXR ___: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there is continued globular enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with essentially normal pulmonary vasculature, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. The basilar regions are substantially clear than on the previous study with only minimal residual atelectatic change. . LENIs of LLE ___: IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. . LENIs: ___: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg. Note is made that the calf veins of the left leg could not be visualized due to open skin lesions. . Right Heart Cath with biopsy ___: SiteSysDiasEndMeanA WaveV WaveHR ___   ___ RV   ___ RA       ___ . TTE: ___ Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the present study was done to localize right heart biopsy. Post biopsy, no evidence of pericardial effusion or VSD seen     Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo M with CHF with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF ___ ___ echo), pulmonary hypertension, T2DM, afib (on coumadin), chronic renal insufficiency Cr baseline ___, recently discharged on ___ after several day admission for DVT and presumed PE, LLE cellulitis and PNA, initially re-presented (___) to ___ with hypoglycemia, ___, leukocytosis, as well as hypotension. Transferred from FICU to CCU for presumed CHF and ?cardiogenic shock.  . # HYPOTENSION: Patient presented to the FICU with hypotension in ___ initially which in the setting of leukocytosis, low CVP and high central venous O2 gave concern for distributive/septic shock picture, despite lack of a clear source. However during his recent hospitalization one week prior to this admission, he was being treated for pneumonia and cellulitis which was most likely the source for his septic shock. In addition, patient had with elevated creatinine, dry appearance on exam suggestive of hypovolemic component. He was started on vanc and zosyn for broad coverage for septic shock and was given fluid cautiously given his known cardiomyopathy. An arterial line was started for invasive monitoring of blood pressure given variable cuff readings. In the FICU Levophed, which was started in the ED, was continued for pressure support. however patient remained hypotensive, and in context of known cardiomyopathy, dobutamine was started for inotropy. He was transfered to CCU for question of cardiogenic shock compoenent to his hypotension. On echo patient was found to have pattern of restriction physiology with question of amyloid; SPEP/UPEP were negative. He was considered to be preload dependend because of this restrictive physiology therefore he continued to receive small fluid boluses. Dopamine and levophed were weaned off on arrival to CCU. Patient's bp cotninued to remain in the ___ which was considered his baseline. He continued to have good mentation with his low BPs.  He had a right heart cath with biopsy to get definiteve answer regaring his restrictive pattern. Cardiac biopsy showed amyloidosis. Repeat echo after biopsy showed worsening cardiomyoptahy. He did not have any significant improvement for functional standpoint. Therefore palliative care was consulted and family meeting held during which patient's poor prognosis was dicusses. Patient and family agreed to DNR/DNI status with discharge to ___ and transition to hospice care. . # PNEUMONIA: Patient was to complete course of levofloxacin 750 mg IV Q48H for pneumonia from prior hospitalization. CXR appeared benign but given presentation concerning for septic shock and leukocytosis, he was covered for HCAP with vanc/zosyn. 

. # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: In the initial course of this hospitlization he continued to have frequent episodes of afib/flutter with RVR in the setting of holding metoprolol for his hypertension. However after controlling patient's pain (from LLE cellulitis and ulcer-->see below), his rate was brought under better control. He initially presented with supertherpuetic INR and his coumadin was held (--> see below). Once his INR became sub-therapuetic he was switched to hepain gtt. On discharge, unable to obtain labs as pt is a difficult stick and declined further attempts.He was discharge on 3mg of coumadin. He will have his next INR drawn at ___ at ___. . # LLE CELLULITIS/Overlying Ulcer: Patient was to complete doxycycline hyclate 100 mg PO Q12H for LLE cellulitis from his previous hospitalization. However he was covered with vancomycin and zosyn during this hospital stay given leukocytosis and spetic shock. His pain was controlled wtih tramadol, acetominophen and oxycodone. He was seen by wound care for management of his ulcers overlying the cellulitis. His ulcers were thought to be from poor perfusion to his lower extremity given severe history of CAD and PVD. He was also seen by vascular surgery who recommended adaptic to open air, compression wrap with coban and follow up in six weeks after discharge. Repeat LENIS did not show any DVTs in the lower extremity. 

# SACRAL PRESSURE ULCER: Wound care was consulted who continued to monitor his sacral ulcer and changed his dressing on daily basis. . # COAGULOPATHY: On admission he had an INR 4.1 despite reportedly not taking coumadin for two weeks. He did not have any active bleed. His elevated INR was thought to be from vitamin K defiency in the setting of poor po intake and continued antibiotcs use. He was given 1mg of vitamin K with decrease in INR to 1.8. He was started back on heparin gtt and restarted on coumadin.  . # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: His baseline Cr if ___ howver on admissin he presented with Cr of 5. His elevated Cr was thought to be prerenal in etiolgy given poor po intake and poor perfusion to the kidneys from his low BPs. Hi Cr responded well to fluids and returned back to baseline level. Per prior OMR outpatient renal notes he is not HD candidate per out-pt renal note. . # THROAT PAIN: Patient developed throat pain on hospital day 1. Physical exam Likely thrush, 1+ budding yeast on throat swab. HIV, HBV, HCV negative. Started nystatin swish and swallows. . # HYPOGLYCEMIA: Patient hypoglycemic requiring D10 drip initially. Thought to be secondary to renal failure and difficulty clearing home glipizide dosing. Improved after holding glipizide, and D10 was discontinued. Pt has been switched to glargine at night and oral diabetic meds discontinued. . # ABDOMINAL PAIN/MILD TRANSAMINITIS: Given leukocytosis and abdominal pain, cdiff was sent, which was negative. KUB was performed which was reassuring, and RUQ U/S was consistent with congestion, likely ___ CHF. HIDA scan also performed which was normal. . Transitions of Care: - Next INR to be drawn on ___ -Pt is DNR/DNI -Pt will follow up as an outpt with cardiology  Medications on Admission: 1. Simvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY 2. Furosemide 20 mg IV DAILY:PRN SOB from pulmonary edema 3. Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY 4. Torsemide 60 mg PO BID 5. Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% Cream 1 Appl TP BID:PRN pruritis

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of your during this hospitalization. You were admitted because of low blood pressure which was thought to from combination of infection and your cardiomyopathy (worsening pump function of your heart).  You were treated with antibiotics for your infection. You also had cardiac cathethrization (heart studies) which showed worsening of your heart function and a biopsy of the heart muscle was done and the results are pending. After a family meeting, you decided to change your code status to DNR/DNI with focus on aggressive symptom management. 

During this hospitalization you also had ulcers in your sacrum and in your leg which were cared for by wound care with regular dressing changes.  Followup Instructions: ___
