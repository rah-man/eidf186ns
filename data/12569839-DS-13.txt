 History of Present Illness: ___ yo M with HCV cirrhosis and R hip replacement in ___ c/b by septic arthritis, s/p washout and replacement in mid ___ at ___. OR cultures grew rare MRSA. He was initially started on vancomycin but was persistantly febrile. His fevers were attributed to vancomycin vs surgical hematoma so the patient was switched to daptomycin to complete a 6 week course. He was discharged to ___ on ___ with a R subclavian line (placed ~ 5 wks ago per patient) for daptomycin administration with temperature of 100. Per ___, the patient was having persistant fevers as high as 102.6 during rehab stay. On the day prior to admission, he became somewhat forgetful with poor attention. Per patient, this was likely due to narcotic pain medications. Pt notes increased L hip pain as R hip pain resolved s/p surgery with ambulation. For these reasons, he was brought into the ED.  .  In the ED, initial vs were: 101.4 95 119/77 18 100% RA. The patient is alert but confused, later A&Ox3 on exam and able to give clear history of recent events.

CXR showed mild bibasilar atelectasis. XR of hip showed severe arthritis without evidence of acute infection recognizing that cross sectional imaging evaluation would be more appropriate if high suspicion of infection. VS prior to transfer were: 98.8 64 112/65 16 96ra.  .  .  Review of sytems:  (+) Per HPI  (-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 58 ___ 46 4 31      ___  ABDOMEN U.S.: The liver demonstrates no textural abnormalities. There is a small focal hyperechoic lesion noted within the right lobe of the liver measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm, likely a small hemangioma. In addition, dense hyperechoic calcification likely related to a benign granuloma is noted within the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 0.9 cm. No concerning focal liver lesions are identified. There is no intra- or ___ biliary dilatation. The main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you during your admission. You were admitted for confusion. This was likely due to too much pain medications. Your confusion resolved while you were in the emergency department. You have been having fevers that have been treated with antibiotics since your right hip surgery. Because you continue to have fevers, you are being transferred back to ___ to undergo surgery to remove the infection.

We changed your antibiotics to vancomycin. We also added some vitamin and a stool softener. 

It was a pleasure meeting you and participating in your care.  Followup Instructions: ___
