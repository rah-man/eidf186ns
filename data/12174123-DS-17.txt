 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ PMHx THN, HLD, CHF with LVEF 40%, ILD, antiphospholipid syndrome with h/o DVT on Coumadin, CAD, chronic anemia, CAD, stage 3 CKD, T2DM, recent L hip fracture s/p ORIF, and recent hospitalization for chest wall hematoma who presents from rehab with coffee ground emesis.

The history is obtained from the patient and his daughter. In brief, he was recently admitted in ___ for chest wall hematoma, L chest wall pain as a result of midline trauma. He suffered acute blood loss anemia requiring 2u pRBC transfusion and was discharged with Hgb 8.3. His course was further complicated by urinary retention, but he was able to pass his voiding trial and did not require Foley catheter at discharge. He was discharged to ___ where his daughter reports that he again was initially found to be retaining urine for which a Foley was placed. His Foley was removed 1 week ago and since then, he has had decreased PO intake in the setting of intermittent nausea and NBNB emesis with no PO intake at all today. He has had no documented fevers at rehab, but per daughter's report, he has been intermittently diaphoretic and when she checked his axillary temperature, he had low grade temperature of 99.0. He has had new urinary incontinence and PVR today at rehab showed 400 cc's urine for which another Foley was placed. Today, he had an episode of 150 cc's of coffee ground emesis. He has not had any BRBPR or black tarry stools. Of note, while at rehab, his home Lasix had been inadvertently held initially, but due to worsening BLE edema, his home Lasix was increased to 40 mg BID recently. His daughter notes that his BLE edema L > R is much improved than prior.  In the ED, initial VS 98.6, 83, 131/83, 16, 94% on 4L NC. His Tmax was 102.3 and he was quickly weaned off oxygen and is now on RA. Initial labs showed wnl chem7 with Cr 0.8, wnl LFT and Tbili, wnl lipase, WBC 16.3, Hgb 11.3 (8.3 at discharge), Plt 403, Trop-T 0.03 with CKMB 1, lactate 2.2, INR 3.3, UA notable for large leuks and 179 WBCs. CXR only demonstrated findings of his chronic ILD w/o PNA. CTA ab/pelvis showed marked thickening of the urinary bladder with urothelial hyperenhancement concerning for bladder infection; no evidence of pyelonephritis.  He was given Vanc/Zosyn prior to transfer to the floor.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports ongoing but slowly improving L hip pain. He has no abdominal pain, flank pain, and no current n/v. He denies any symptoms of dysuria.  He has had no R shoulder pain though he has been using his arm to support himself with ___ at rehab. He does not recall any specific trauma.

1. Weakness, debility, multiple comorbidities and chronic medical problems -Unfortunately patient with multiple medical problems and general decline. There have been multiple discussions with patient's family (he does not have capacity to engage) regarding goals of care, which seem to change frequently between home, SNF, and hospice with concern that demise is imminent verse anticipated recovery. Family is extremely conflicted determining goals of care. Appreciate palliative care's assistance. They felt that Good ___ would be good group to transition from outpatient palliative care to hospice as patient's condition dictated. Although family wanted to bring patient home they feel his needs are too great and are hopeful he will improve with ___. If he does not improve, participate with ___, or maintain PO intake they will plan for transition to hospice. 

2. Toxic metabolic encephalopathy with underlying dementia -Difficult to tease out what is baseline dementia vs delirium vs apathy wishing to stop medical treatments and not engage with medical personal. He may have had some improvement with treatment of UTI but overall he is not very engaging, talkative, and often refuses medical care.

3. UTI with sepsis -Pseudomonas UTI currently on ciprofloxacin through ___ (he received 1 dose on ___ and then restarted ___.  Pending urine cultures and in setting of aspiration pneumonia he also received ceftazidime ___, ceftriaxone ___, vancomycin ___, and metronidazole ___. 

4. Chronic aspiration w/ dysphagia ?aspiration pneumonia -It is possible that patient developed aspiration pneumonia with transient oxygen requirement. He was treated with antibiotics as outlined above currently on room air. As per speech and swallow patient will need full evaluation for further recommendations including video swallow, which he has been refusing/not participating in. Patient's daughter is aware of chronic aspiration, recent SLP evaluation a month ago, and patient's refusal of thickened liquids essentially stating that despite their recommendations/investigations the patient isn't willing to comply. Patient declined G-tube and as this will not prevent aspiration this is not an option for him; family aware that G-tube is not an option. If patient changes to hospice care his diet can be changed to regular per comfort/his wishes. 

5. Oliguria, CKD III, chronic urinary retention h/o BPH -Patient has had some intermittent episodes of urinary retention. However, he also does not make much urine in setting of poor PO intake, which can be mistaken for retention.  Tamsulosin was increased to 0.8mg daily. Bladder scans can continue at rehab with straight cath if needed.

6. Supratherapeutic INR h/o Heterozygous Factor V leiden and Antiphospholipid syndrome with h/o DVT/PE -Patient taking warfarin 2mg daily at home. He last received warfarin 1mg ___ with subsequent supratherapeutic INR peaking at 6.4 on ___ currently 4.1 today ___. This is likely due to antibiotics. Without active bleeding did not reverse INR. Repeat INR ___ with close monitoring and hold warfarin until INR <3.0.

Chronic Medical Problems 1. Ischemic heart failure EF 40%, HTN, HLD: euvolemic. Holding furosemide. This can be resumed once patient consistently taking PO as he is currently at risk for dehydration . Patient is not on ACEi or beta blocker (unclear reason why and will defer to PCP/cardiologist) 2. ILD/NSIP/nonspecified autoimmune disease: continue prednisone 5mg daily and vitamin D  3. Chronic anemia with recent chest wall hematoma and question of prior coffee-ground emesis: Traumatic chest wall hematoma resolving and hemoglobin stable. Prior coffee-ground emesis likely ___ tear and since resolved. Continue omeprazole.  4. R shoulder pain: no history of trauma. Xray without fracture. Likely musculoskeletal pain. 5. Recent left hip fracture status post ORIF: Evaluated by Ortho in clinic last week, felt to be recovering well. He has not needed oxycodone here but can consider if pain worsens. 6. Steroid-induced DM/hyperglycemia: SSI
