U/A on ___: Consistent with UTI Urine Culture: Grew out skin flora consistent with contamination  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was pre-admitted to the ORL service on ___ for pre-hydration because of her renal failure. This was arranged via the patient's nephrologist and Dr. ___. She was started on her home meds, a regular diet until 12am and on NS at 100cc/hr for a total of 2L before surgery. She had pre-op labs that were unremarkable except for a WBC of 12 and a U/A consistent with a UTI. SHe had been having some polyuria at home and thus was started on Cipro PO for a 5 day course. The renal team followed her while in house and recommended holding her BP meds as well as her lasix until after surgery. On HD 2 she was taken to the OR for a right sided parotidectomy. This was uncomplicated, please refer to the OP note for full details. She emerged to the PACU in stable condition and then went to the floor. She had a 2L O2 requirement at that time and had one drain in the right neck. Her neck was flat on POC and her CN VII was functional with only mild weakness in the marginal mandibular branch. She was tolerating a regular diet. On POD 1 she was doing well but the drain output was too high to pull. We stopped her fluids and were able to get her off O2 when we restarted her Lasix. Her home BP meds were restarted on POD 2. Her drain remained too high to pull on POD 2 and she was kept overnight for further drain watch. On POD 3 she was doing well and tolerating a regular diet, she was ambulating without difficulty and voiding without assistance and without dysuria. Her sugars were well controlled and her drain was removed as it had met criteria. She was discharged home with follow up for suture removal in 1 week.  Medications on Admission: HOME MEDICATIONS 1.
