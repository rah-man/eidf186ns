IMAGING: ======== CXR (___): IMPRESSION: Findings again compatible with patient's known pulmonary fibrosis without definite superimposed acute process, noting that subtle change would be difficult to detect based on a portable film. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with severe pulm hypertension, recently discharged s/p IV diuresis with evidence of signigificant worsening lung disease, who presents again with dyspnea and hypoxia.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # IPF and Pulm HTN: Worsening underlying IPF (thought to be driving her pulm HTN) is the likely etiology for her presentation of dyspnea and hypoxia. Desatted to 80's on regular 4L home O2, improved to mid 90's on 4L in ED and on the floor. Limited improvement despite combination of lasix 40mg IV, methylprednisone, and levofloxacin. Did not appear to be volume overloaded, being at prior discharge dry weight. Prior VQ scan with intermediate probability of PE though CT scan prior appears to be most akin to IPF. No e/o infection. Plan had been to use sildenafil for mild sx relief given mild response to NO as an outpt but had not been able to setup after last discharge yet. As a result, pulmonary was consulted who agreed that sx largely driven by her IPF w/ no significant options available. Recommended palliative care discussion moving forawrd. Her outpatient pulmonologists, ___ and ___, were also notified with Dr. ___ she would follow-up with the pt to initiate sildenafil treatment for symptomatic relief since previously NO responsive on RHC. Paperwork was sent to ___ compassionate care to help obtain medication for patient due to lack of insurance coverage. Palliative care assisted in goals of care discussions with pt deciding to become DNR/DNI with decision to try rehab to help her improve functionally. Also recommended liquid oxycodone for treatment of dyspnea related discomfort. Continued discussion with palliative warranted moving forward. Pt evaluated pt with recommendation for rehab, continue to adjust O2 needs as needed, and recommended ways to minimize overly exerting herself. Continued follow-up as an outpatient with cardiology, pulmonology and palliative care arranged.

Weight on discharge 52.5 kg.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Paperwork to ___ faxed to assist pt in obtaining sildenafil for palliative treatment of sx related to her pulm HTN - Continue to titrate O2 as needed, consider nasal pendant for additional O2 - Continue palliative care follow-up to assist w/ pt discomfort with dyspnea, breathing - Continue goals of care discussion with patient - Continue assess for services after discharge from rehab since more assistance will be needed - Consider hospice care as an option once patient ready - Made DNR/DNI during this hospitalization  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
