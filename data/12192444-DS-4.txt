 History of Present Illness: ___ is a ___ man with a history of recent DVT and pulmonary embolism in ___, currently on Xarelto for anticoagulation and at least a 6 month history of poor PO intake, abdominal pain, early satiety and edema who was transferred to ___ for evaluation by GI for push enteroscopy.   ___ reports first feeling unwell the end of the ___ / early ___. He indicates it started with ___ of appetite and feeling "full" quickly while eating. He reports over the course of the next ___ weeks he had a 20lb weight loss and increased fatigue to the point he was having trouble walking up stairs. Thereafter he began having increase swelling of his abdomen, lower extremities and arms. He also reports that he develops scrotal swelling sometimes. With the swelling he gained about 20lbs so he is now near his typical weight but with much ___ mass. He has had intermittent follow up because of no health insurance and he cannot pay for doctors ___ however, ___ was prescribed Lasix for the edema which has not helped much. More recently, he presented to an OSH around ___ time with worsening ___ edema and SOB and at that time was diagnosed with ___ DVT and PE (size and location are not available to this provider). He denies diarrhea and reports he actually has been more constipated only going every few days which has been atypical for him. No nausea or vomiting. He does also describe bleeding with stool, bright red blood on toilet paper which he describes noticing "at the end" of a BM. During that admission he was noted on work up of weight loss and anasarca to have a small bowel stricture seen on small bowel follow through (___). He was referred to GI for small bowel endoscopy and or capsule study though he was unable to follow up for reasons described above.  As a result of the ___ study he was referred to ___ for push enteroscopy. He presented to advanced endoscopy center today without new complaints. The procedure was uncomplicated and found dramatic dilation of the lumen with of mid/distal jejunum, multiple superficial and deep ulcers distal to the and a tight stricture in the jejunum all concerning for Crohn's Disease. He was admitted to ___ for nutrition, GI consultation and CRS consultation.  Currently, he feels well without pain, nausea or vomiting. He reports his edema is roughly typical for him over the last month though has more scrotal edema recently.

IMAGING: 

___ MRE IMPRESSION:  1. There are at 3 short segments of jejunum which show decreased caliber, wall thickening, and mucosal hyperenhancement with mild prestenotic dilation. There are intervening more normal segments of small bowel. Distribution of findings including stenosis, prestenotic dilation, and findings of active inflammation are similar to the limited MRE from ___ and CT from ___ is no fistula identified. There is no collection. 2. There is nonocclusive thrombus in the right internal iliac artery, unchanged from recent CT. 3. Large pleural effusions, unchanged. 4. Minimal ascites, improved from prior. 

___ abd u/s: IMPRESSION: Small ascites. 

___ TTE Conclusions  The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 61 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Prominent bilateral pleural effusions and ascites are present. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta. No pathologic flow identified. Very prominent bilateral pleural effusions and ascites. 

___ CT CHEST (AFTER ___ L ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Right lung lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli as above. 2. Evaluation of left subsegmental pulmonary arteries is limited. No evidence of left pulmonary embolus to the segmental level. 3. Large right and moderate left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated atelectasis that is worse on the left. 4. Left lower lobe ground-glass and solid parenchymal opacities are concerning for infection/pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. 5. Mild pulmonary edema. 6. Severe anasarca.

___ CTE IMPRESSION: 1. Small and large bowel wall thickening with mucosal hyperemia in a distribution and appearance most typical for active inflammatory bowel disease, less likely infection. 2. Several areas of small bowel narrowing/potential strictures with a notable transition point approximately 10 cm from the ileocecal valve resulting in partial small bowel obstruction.  No evidence of abscess, free air, or pneumatosis. 3. Colonic diverticulosis. 4. Extensive anasarca, mesenteric edema and ascites. 5. Small ventral wall hernias as above.

___ MRE IMPRESSION: 1. Only limited sequences were obtained due to equipment failure. The patient should be rescheduled for imaging and consideration for CT is suggested given large volume ascites. 2. Dilated loops of small bowel noted with abrupt transition point in the right midabdomen, likely due to stricture. 3. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions. ========================== DISCHARGE RESULTS

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male, with past history of DVT/PE on rivaroxaban, who initially presented with anasarca ___ protein losing enteropathy with new diagnosis of Crohn's. Hospital course c/b acute hypoxemic respiratory failure likely ___ reexpansion pulmonary edema and volume overload.

# Jejenual Stricture # Protein wasting enteropathy # Severe protein-calorie malnutrition Unclear etiology, Crohn's disease high on differential but location of strictures is somewhat atypical, celiac less likely given normal tTG. Non-celiac enteropathy is possible, including allergic/eosinophilic etiologies. Less likely etiologies include malignancy, paraneoplastic process, or other infiltrative dx such as amyloid. Serum alpha-1-antitrypsin normal, stool pending. His pathology showed chronic and active inflammation. Quantiferon Gold unable to be run due to phlebotomy error, and not re-run given treatment with IV steroids. Stool alpha-1-antitrypsin negative. Patient treated with IV/PO methylpred for approximately 2 weeks and transitioned to PO budesonide. He did require TPN during hospitalization given severe malnutrition and strictures. His diet was advanced per GI and he tolerated a regular, low-fiber diet. TPN was discontinued and he was able to maintain adequate nutrient intake by mouth. He received nutrition counseling prior to discharge. 

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure # Bilateral Pleural Effusions # Anasarca 2* hypoalbuminemia, s/p 5 vials of albumin Patient developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure on ___ requiring transfer to the ICU. This was thought to be due to rapid re-expansion of pleural effusion following thoracentesis, worsened by diffuse volume overload and anasarca related to low albumin state. Patient was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix and discharged on home PO Lasix. 

# Papular rash Patient noted to have a pruritic popular rash, which per patient as present for weeks but worse within the past few weeks. Dermatology was consulted and concerned regarding nutrition deficiency causing rash. Thus, vitamin C, niacin, copper, and zinc levels were sent and are pending at discharge. Patient should have dermatology f/u, which will be scheduled. 

# DVT/PE Diagnosed previously in ___, on Rivaroxaban at home. Patient required a heparin bridge during hospitalization given need for procedures, but rivaroxaban was restarted and tolerated well. 

# Anemia Patient's hb on ___ noted to be 6.6-6.7, likely poor marrow function given poor nutrition, with mild blood loss from repeating blood draws and small hemorrhoidal bleeding. No evidence of active GI bleed or other bleeding. Negative hemolysis workup. Patient received 1 unit PRBC on ___ + 2 units on ___. Anemia remained stable at discharge with hb of 8.0.

# Asthma: Continued albuterol, singulair, and advair

# Hypothyroidism: Patient started on levothyroxine a couple of weeks prior to admission. Home levothyroxine was continued. He should have repeat TSH checked in8 weeks.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You were admitted for small bowel strictures and total body edema. For this, we started you on nutrition by IV ("total parenteral nutrition, or TPN") and took a biopsy of your small bowel, which was concerning for Crohn's Disease. For this, you were treated with steroids and transitioned to Budesonide, which you should continue to take. 

You also had removal of fluid from around your lungs ("thoracentesis"). Your fluid build up is all from the low levels of protein in your blood, which is improving with better nutrition. Please continue to increase your PO intake as much as tolerated with a low-fiber diet. 

If you have any increasing abdominal pain, increased diarrhea, please call the GI clinic at: ___. Or call ___ at ___ and ask to page the GI fellow on call. 

You should follow-up with your doctors as listed below. Please take care.

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
