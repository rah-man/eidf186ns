 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old male with history of CLL, Stage III CKD, CAD s/p CABG who presented to the ED with failure to thrive and was found to be hyperglycemic, hyponatremic, and to have a community-acquired PNA on CXR. . # Community-acquired PNA: The patient was admitted with a mild leukocytosis with a left shift as well as a new infiltrate on CXR. He reported feeling cold, though had not checked his temperature recently. He was treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone while in house. Ceftriaxone was discontinued on discharge as patient was clinically stable. Azithromycin was discontinued once pt was started on levaquin (see below). Pt was maintained on RA during his hospitalization and did not require oxygen supplementation. Blood cultures were no growth to date at time of discharge. . # diabetic foot ulcer: pt noticed to have ulcer between third and forth toe on right foot. The ___ toe ulcer is round and approx 0.4 cm with pink base. There is periwound maceration. The ___ toe ulcer is approx 0.6 cm and has a yellow wound bed. The toe was faintly erythematous. There was no odor to either toe ulcer. The pt has neuropathy and does not feel pain to foot. He was started on bactrim and levoquin for treatment of diabetic ulcers and was evaluated by wound care who recommended the following treatments: cleanse skin/ulcer and pat dry, apply aloe vesta moisturizer to intact dry skin, cover wounds with small piece of aquacel ag sheet followed by dry gauze then ABD pad, wrap with Kerlix or conform, change daily. He should follow up with podiatry . # Hyponatremia: The patient presented with new hyponatremia with a sodium of 125. Given his history of polyuria with elevated serum glucose levels and decreased peripheral edema, most likely this was hypovolemic hyponatremia. He received 2 L NS and his sodium normalized. His sodium remained stable for remainder of hospital course. . # Social/Home Issues: The patient's ED visit was spurred by inability to care for himself at home as he was not able to take his medications regularly. His wife was also admitted for severe depression and inability to care for herself. He and his wife have been considering moving to an assisted living facility and this should be pursued as they do not appear safe at home. . # Diabetes Type II/Hyperglycemia: The patient was quite hyperglycemic in the ED on presentation, but did not have an AG or ketones in his urine. He received two dose of insulin in the ED with temporary normalization of his BG. However, his sugars became elevated again to 300-400s, despite resuming home diabetic regimen. ___ was consulted and recommended increasing his insulin to lantus 13 units qAM and increasing glipizide from 5mg daily to 7.5mg BID. He was also covered with sliding scale insulin. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # Chronic Anemia: Hct of 28.8 on admission which appears to be at his baseline. There was no clinical evidence of bleeding. His B12 and folate were normal, iron was very mildly decreased and should be followed as an outpatient. . # CLL: pt has WBC at baseline (___). He is currently asymptomatic with no worsening of his cytopenia. He is scheduled for follow-up with hem/onc in 3 months. . # Stage III CKD: The patient's creatinine appears to be at baseline. All medications were renally dosed. . # History of CAD s/p CABG: He was continued on metoprolol, aspirin and lipitor. . # Hypertension/dCHF: He was continued on metopolol and amlodipine. His lasix was initially held as he did not appear volume overloaded. This was resumed at low dose prior to discharge. He may require adjustment of his medications in rehab. . # Depression: continued on home cymbalta. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt is full code. . During this hospitalization, pt had several changes to his diabetes regimen, including increased lantus and increased glipizide. This should be monitored and adjusted as necessary as he does have a history of asymptomatic hypoglycemia. If he is persistently requiring >4 unit humaolog with meals, consider increasing his glipizide to 10mg BID. . Pt's lasix dose was decreased during this hospitalization. He should be re-assessed daily for need to increase lasix dose. . Pt is being treated for diabetic foot ulcer. He has a history of severe diabetic neuropathy and has no sensation. He also has PAD putting him at increased risk for ulcers. He should be treated with a ___long with daily wound dressings. He should follow-up with podiatry next week. If wound continues to worsen, he may need vascular surgery follow-up given severe peripheral arterial disease. .
