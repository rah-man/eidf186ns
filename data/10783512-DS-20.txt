TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [ ] Patient started on levothyroxine 50mcg qd while inpatient. Will need to follow up with endocrinology in ~4 weeks. Can either see an endocrinologist that his PCP recommends or can call ___ to set up an appointment at ___ Endocrinology. [ ] Patient will need thyroid function tests checked on ___. [ ] Anti-TPO antibodies pending at time of discharge. Primary inpatient team will follow up on these results (although expect them to be negative given hypothyroidism likely from amiodarone toxicity). [ ] Amiodarone was held as it is likely etiology of hypothyroidism. Patient should discuss with his cardiologist prior to restarting. [ ] Metoprolol and Lasix were held in the setting of hypotension and bradycardia (40-50s). Patient should discuss with his cardiologist prior to restarting these medications. [ ] If patient continues to be bradycardic and hypotensive despite hypothyroid treatment and holding metoprolol, can consider further workup for autonomic instability. [ ] Patient with ___ on admission, Creatinine up to 1.5 on admission from 1.2 on last discharge. Creatinine on day of discharge was 1.3. Please recheck Cr 1 week from discharge at PCP follow up. [ ] Patient with chronic Left pleural effusion s/p VATS. He is asymptomatic and should follow up with IP as outpatient as needed. 

ACUTE ISSUES: ============= # Hypothyroidism Pt with elevated TSH, low FT4 and FT3 found on labs at OSH Cardiology. Symptoms included general weakness, vision changes, and constipation for several weeks prior to admission. Presentation not consistent with myxedema coma at time of admission. Etiology of hypothyroidism thought most likely secondary to Amiodarone toxicity, however of note was found to have euthyroid sick syndrome in the ___ given mildly elevated TSH 16, FT3 1.62, and FT4 1.0. Anti-TPO antibodies were pending at time of discharge. Endocrine was consulted and recommended starting levothyroxine. Patient was discharged on levothyroxine 50mcg qd with plan to uptitrate in ~4 weeks as an outpatient. He will follow up either at ___ endocrinology or with an endocrinologist of his PCP's recommendation. Thyroid function tests will be rechecked on ___. Amiodarone was held on admission and will not be restarted until patient discusses with his cardiologist. He was started on a bowel regimen for constipation. 

# Recurrent triggers # Hypotension # Bradycardia Patient with multiple episodes of hypotension with SBP in 60-70s during admission. Patient reported having poor PO fluid intake for the past several weeks. Given poor PO intake, IV Lasix in the ED, and home metoprolol, hypotension was thought most concerning for hypovolemia with concurrent bradycardia and hypothyroidism. Of note, his SBPs from prior hospitalizations and outpatient records was 90-100s. During episodes of hypotension, lactate was normal. He received 250cc LR boluses when necessary, but only gentle fluid administration given chronic difficulties with hypervolemia in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. Metoprolol was held on admission. Hypothyroidism was treated as above. Patient should consider autonomic instability workup if still bradycardic despite treating hypothyroidism and holding metoprolol. 

# ___ on CKD Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 and K 5.6 on admission, up from 1.2 on last discharge. Patient received 80mg IV Lasix in the ED after labs were drawn. Patient was euvolemic on exam. ___ was felt to be due to hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO intake and recent Lasix. Patient had one isolated TTE on ___ with EF 40%, but several days later EF>55%; unclear if this represented recovered HF or (more likely) isolated spurious finding on a suboptimal quality TTE performed while patient was in atrial tachyarrhythmia. Patient received gentle fluid administration given h/o hypervolemia ___ severe aortic stenosis. Creatinine was monitored and was 1.3 on day of discharge. Creatinine should be checked by PCP 1 week after discharge. Home Lasix was held on admission and patient should discuss with his cardiologist prior to restarting. 

# Anemia Anemia on admission thought likely secondary to CLL + iron deficiency anemia. Patient had decrease to 6.3 overnight after admission, with no evidence of active bleeding. He received 1u pRBC ___ AM and over-responded back to baseline of 8. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, hemolysis labs indeterminate (K within normal limits, LDH and T bili elevated but at baseline). Uric acid was slightly elevated but downtrended to normal during admission. CBC was monitored and he required no additional transfusions. 

# Lower extremity edema Patient received 80 mg IV lasix in the ED with output unknown. Per patient, edema is worse than usual but is chronic. Potential etiology of worsening edema included hypothyroidism. Home Lasix was held given hypotension and will not be restarted until patient discusses with outpatient cardiologist. 

# Atrial fibrillation Patient on amiodarone and metoprolol at home. Amiodarone held given hypothyroidism, and Metoprolol held given bradycardia and hypotension. Patient was monitored on tele and remained in sinus rhythm during admission. He was continued on apixaban 5 BID. Metoprolol and Amiodarone were held on discharge until patient discusses with his cardiologist. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # L pleural effusion chronic Patient had recent follow up with IP on ___, per note patient "has had no recurrence of his L pleural effusion after VATS, suggesting that he has pleurodesed". Per note, at the time he was not symptomatic and continues to be asymptomatic. He was not scheduled for follow up and told to return if symptomatic. Chest x-ray on admission was unchanged from prior and patient continues to be asymptomatic. Patient should continue to follow up with outpatient IP as needed. 

# Cardiac constriction LV/RV interdependence seen on TTE ___. No signs of constriction on physical exam on admission. Patient should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.

# Thrombocytopenia Plt 132 on admission, just below baseline ~200s. Stable at 131 on day of discharge. Etiology most likely secondary to history of CLL. Patient should continue to be monitored as an outpatient. 

# RLS Patient was continued on ropinirole. 

# CAD s/p CABG ___ Patient was continued on home ASA and simvastatin. Home metoprolol was held as above.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ ___. 

Why did you come to the hospital?  - You came to the hospital because your outpatient cardiologist was concerned about your thyroid function.  

What did you receive in the hospital?  - You were started on a medicine called levothyroxine to help your low thyroid levels. We think that your decreased thyroid function is from taking amiodarone. - Your heart rate was slow and your blood pressure was low. Your home metoprolol and Lasix were held because they can make your heart beat slower and blood pressure lower. - Your red blood cell count was low. You received a unit of red blood cells. You did not have any evidence of bleeding. 

What should you do once you leave the hospital?  - You should take all of your medications as prescribed (see below). Your metoprolol, amiodarone and Lasix were held during your admission and should not be restarted until you discuss with your cardiologist. - You should call your cardiologist on ___ AM to set up an appointment this week to discuss your medications. - You should also call your primary care doctor ___ AM to set up an appointment this week and to ask if he/she has any specific endocrinologist you should see. - If your primary care doctor does not recommend a specific endocrinologist, you can call ___ to set up an appointment at ___ Endocrinology. 

We wish you the best!  Your ___ Care Team
