Microbiology: ___ SCREEN (Final ___:  No MRSA isolated. . Pathology: # Esophageal Tissue/Lymph Node:  SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT - Final PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 1. Level nine lymph node, excisional biopsy (1A): One lymph node with no carcinoma seen (___).

2. Level 3 lymph node, excisional biopsy (2A): One lymph node with no carcinoma seen (___).

3. Level eight lymph node, excisional biopsy (3A): One lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (___).

4. Esophagus, partial esophagogastrectomy (4A-4AP): A. Minute foci of residual, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus/gastroesophageal junction; see synoptic report and note.

B. Eleven lymph nodes with focally prominent hemorrhage, sinus histiocytosis and reactive changes; no carcinoma seen (___).

C. Gastric segment with focal chronic, predominantly inactive gastritis; H. pylori immunostains are negative, with satisfactory positive control (performed on blocks 4P and 4 W).

Note: The patient is reportedly clinically status-post neadjuvant therapy for a biopsy proven, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No gross lesion is identified. Demonstrated within the distal esophagus/gastroesophageal junction is focal ulceration with marked underlying inflammation and stromal changes, consistent with neoadjuvant therapy effect. Within some of these areas, rare single atypical cells/small clusters are seen within the mucosa and superficial submucosa, and very focally within the deep submucosa and superficial muscularis propria, consistent with focal residual adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect (confirmed by immunostain for cytokeratin cocktail, performed on blocks 4E, 4O, 4AB, 4AG. Seen best on 4AG). One large para-esophageal lymph node demonstrating marked hemorrhage and sinus histiocytosis is identified, likely representing the reportedly previously aspirated lymph node with treatment effect. No overt residual nodal metastasis is identified.             Esophagus: Resection Synopsis Staging according to ___ Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- ___ Edition, ___

. Imaging/Studies: # Video Swallow Eval (___): Penetration with nectar and silent aspiration with thin liquids. # CXR ___ compared to the previous radiograph, the preexisting parenchymal opacities have minimally decreased in extent. Parts of these opacities is certainly caused by the surgical intervention, but other parts, notably in the perihilar areas on the left and right, are likely caused by mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. These edematous changes have decreased in the interval. Also decreased is a moderate left pleural effusion that is better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged severe cardiomegaly. # UGI (___):  1. No esophageal leak. 2. Aspiration from small amount of Optiray and thin barium. # EKG (___): Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response. Low limb lead voltage. ST-T wave flattening in the limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is variation in precordial lead placement and the T wave abnormalities in leads V3-V6 persist without diagnostic interim change. Clinical correlation is suggested.

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on ___ after minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy with cervical anastomosis and jejunostomy tube placement. The procedure went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details). 

Neuro: The patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient was weaned off pressors on POD1. He remained on telemetry and had intermittent ventricular tachycardia (approx 5 beats) a few times each day while in hospital. He was asymptomatic. EKG ___ revealed atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response. The patient's coumadin was restarted at 3mg/day (his home dose) on ___. His INR returned to therapeutic levels before discharge, and he will follow up with his PCP 2 days after discharge for continued coumadin management. 

Pulmonary: The patient was extubated POD1. On POD2, his chest tube was put to waterseal, and he received IV lasix. On POD6, his chest tube was discontinued. He developed worsening shortness of breath on POD 8, and was given IV lasix again daily for the next 4 days. His CXR gradually improved, and he was weaned back to room air. He was able to ambulate without oxygen supplementation at the time of discharge. He will continue furosemide 20mg PO for two days after discharge until his appointment with his PCP, who will determine if he needs to continue this medication. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient had some purulent drainage from his neck JP site, but remained afebrile. This was followed and diminished progressively during hospitalization. He will have continued daily dry dressing changes as needed through ___ at home.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required. The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.  Medications on Admission: 1. Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY 2.
