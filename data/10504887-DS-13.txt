IMAGING: ___ CXR - hyperinflated lungs, no PNA.  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with h/o CAD s/p DES to LAD on ___, HFpEF, hypertension, hypothyroidism, CKD, bilateral carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, paroxysmal afib (no longer on warfarin), anemia, and recent upper GI bleed, who presents with bilateral back/flank pain for the past week. . # URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA positive and good sample. She had significant leukocytosis on presentation. Per ED HPI patient has had fevers, but patient herself adamantly denies this and she has had no fevers here. No other likely sources of infection were identified. UCx ultimately grew MBF + predominant organism of enterococcus sp. which was pan-S. She improved clinically (improving WBC, improving low-back pain) with treatment with ceftriaxone. She received a total of 4 days of IV abx (IV vanc/cefepime in ED on ___, IV CTX on ___. Once culture results returned pan-S enterococcus sp., we discussed with the ___ Stewardship Team (AST) re: optimal PO abx regimen for her given penicillin allergy and improvement on CTX, which theoretically does not cover enterococcus. They advised that macrobid, fosfomycin, and cefpodoxime were all potentially reasonable choices, and advised a slightly prolonged course given the degree of her leukocytosis and ? of pyelonephritis.  Given low overall suspicion for pyelo, since her physical exam did not change significantly as she clinically improved, we went with macrobid for a total of 6 additional days to complete 10 total days of abx. Advised patient re: what signs/symptoms would warrant her seeking medical attention (fevers, shaking chills, increasing flank pain, dysuria, or other concerning symptoms). On the day of discharge she said she felt well, was having pain consistent with her chronic pain, and felt comfortable going home. . # Acute on chronic lower back pain: initially patient reported that pain was just 1 week in duration. Later she informed us that lower back pain has been a chronic issue, but was acutely worse over past week. Exam revealed allodynia. Treated with Tylenol, lidocaine patch, and tramadol PRN. Gradually improved.  She worked with ___, who found her to be at her approximate baseline level of pain and mobility. . # FAILURE TO THRIVE: Patient reportedly is not doing well caring for herself at home. Per outpatient records she has not allowed ___ to come to her home and has also had very poor nutrition.  There might also be a significant psychiatric component.  Nutrition recs: Ensure TID, MVI w/ minerals. ___ recs: she is approximately at her baseline, mobilizes with rolling walker. Patient declined ___ services at home. SW consulted and offered services, but patient declined. We think she will benefit from treatment for depression and continued offers of additional assistance/home support from her primary providers going forward. . # DEPRESSION: unclear if new onset MDD vs. recurrent based on history. Psych consulted given the concurrence of her apparent depression with failure to thrive at home. They recommended starting mirtazapine 7.5 mg PO QHS x2 nights, then increasing to 15 mg PO QHS. She tolerated the first dose of mirtazapine without issue on ___ and was agreeable to continuing this medication. She should have f/u eval/tx for depression going forward. She said she was definitely willing to follow-up with her PCP ___: depression, but was not as sure about her willingness to establish care with a psychiatrist. . # CAD s/p DES TO LAD: Given recent DES to LAD will require continued DAPT with ASA/Plavix even if bleeding. Continued ASA, Plavix. Continued atorvastatin, metoprolol. . # ANEMIA: stable, no evidence of clinically significant bleeding on dual anti-platelet therapy. . # GERD, RECENT UPPER GI BLEED: Recent hospitalization for presumed upper GI bleed requiring 1u PRBC. Was supposed to have outpatient GI f/u with EGD. Continued pantoprazole. - Hgb has been stable on her home anti-platelet regimen, will defer additional w/u for GIB to outpatient GI. Has f/u scheduled on ___. . # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Was initially bradycardic, now resolved. Metoprolol dose was decreased during recent hospitalization, presumably for bradycardia. Not on warfarin due to bleeding risk/hx of bleeding. Continued metoprolol 25mg XL. . # HYPERTENSION: Amlodipine recently stopped, but unclear reason. Has been mildly hypertensive at times during hospitalization.  Continued home metoprolol, no additional agents added to her regimen. . # HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued levothyroxine. . . Time in care: 45 minutes in patient care, patient counseling, and care coordination on the day of discharge.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection Depression Acute on chronic lower back pain  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).  Discharge Instructions: Ms ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital with worsening back pain and reported fevers and were found to have elevated inflammatory markers and a urinalysis suggestive of a urinary tract infection. Your urine culture ultimately grew multiple bacteria, with one predominant. You were treated with IV antibiotics and improved, and on the day of discharge you were transitioned to an oral antibiotic (Macrobid) based on the urine culture results.

You were also evaluated by the Psychiatry team based on our concern for, and your report of, significant depression. You were started on a new medication (Mirtazapine) for treatment of depression. We do not expect an immediate change in how you feel with this medication, but are hopeful that it will help your depression over the coming days to weeks. It will be important that you follow-up with your primary care physician regarding your depression.

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were in the hospital, and we wish you a full and speedy recovery.

Sincerely, The ___ Medicine Team  Followup Instructions: ___
