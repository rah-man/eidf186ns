Two recent admissions. The first was from ___ - ___ he was admitted with a GI bleed and was admitted to the ICU where he was given pRBC. A colonoscopy and EGD were unrevealing. A capsule study was done and in speaking with the GI service they identified small bowel AVMs which were felt to be the cultrip lesions. At the time of discharge, his hematocrit was 28.3. 

He was then re-admitted from ___ with bleeding from a midline site. This admission was complicated by pancytopenia (PLT as low as 49; HCT as low as 24.6; WBC as low as 3.2), coagulopathy (INR 1.5) and an ESBL Klebsiella UTI - this was treated meropenum.  Since discharge, he has been at rehab. Pain has been a major issue for him (in particular back pain). He has also been feeling generally "unwell" though he has a hard time clarifying. On the day of admission, he was noted to have 3+ black stools (he did not seen them himself). He denies any abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting. He was then sent to the ED for further evaluation.

His CBC was notable for a HCT of 14.7 (subsequently dropped to 12.8) and a platelet count of 15. He had an INR that was somewhat elevated at 1.6 and an elevated lactate at 4.5. He was transfused bolused with 4+ liters of NS, 2 units PRBCs, 2 unit FFP. He was also given 10mg IV decadron. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ man with a history of multiple myeloma who presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia and melena. 

Patient presented to the ED with a hct of 12 and platelets of 10. His GI bleeding was thought to be secondary to known small bowel AVM's (seen on capsule study on prior admission for GIB in ___, in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia. He received 6 units of PRBC's, 3 units platelets, and 2 units of FFP. His hct stabalized around ___. He was started on IV PPI BID. GI was consulted and were considering a repeat enteropscopy while in the ICU but the patient was in severe pain ___ multiple myeloma) this was deferred. After further discussion with the patient's oncologist at the ___, Dr. ___, it was decided that further invasive studies to work up the GI bleeding would likely not yield any change in management since his bleeding is likey from AVMs which are difficult to control.

When his family arrived the IVF boluses were stopped and IV morphine was given instead of the oral dilaudid for pain and discomfort. The palliative care service followed closely.
