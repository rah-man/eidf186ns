Chief Complaint: Fever, nausea, flank pain, nephrostomy tube fell out  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: nephrostomy tube replacement in interventional radiology

 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with past medical history of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features (likely representing two separate primary malignanices - high grade sarcoma, high-grade poorly-differentiated urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features) diagnosed ___ with mets to the vaginal wall, right adnexa, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and right lower lobe of the lung. Her malignancy has been complicated by left-sided hydronephrosis which was interevened upon ___ with a left percutaneous nephrostomy. She has been started on treatment with carboplatin/gemcitabine on ___ (C1D1). Per OMR Oncology notes: she was admitted to ___ on ___ for UTI. Presenting symptoms were fever, nausea, vomiting, and blood from her nephrostomy. Culture positive for enterococcus, strep species, and gram-negative rods. She was treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, Ceftriaxone, and Ciprofloxacin which this was narrowed to Ceftriaxone alone, and transitioned to amoxicillin x 7 days on discharge. ___ she presented to ___ with fevers and L sided flank pain after her left nephrostomy tube fell out. She was originally going to have non-emergent placement of a nephrostomy tube, however, she developed nausea, fever, and left flank pain. She was started on ceftriaxone and transferred to ___. 

Upon arrival to ___ she continues to have nausea and malaise.  Past Medical History: Oncologic History: - ___: mild abdominal pain, with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showing bilateral pulmonary nodules (largest 3 cm), a large 6.3 cm infrarenal AAA, and L-sided hydroureteronephrosis possible due to significant mass effect on the ureter (secondary to large aneurysm, along with non-specific R hepatic hypodensity and colonic diverticulosis). Subsequent duplex ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrated no evidence of a AAA, but did show a heterogeneous mass that encircled the abdominal aorta from below the level of the renal arteries and distal to the aortic bifurcation. - ___: PET-CT shows FDG avidity in a 2.4 cm R adnexal mass, suspicious for ovarian malignancy, as well FDG-avid soft tissue along the posterior bladder wall (suspicious for serosal implants), and an FDG-avid RP mass. Additionally, there was a 3.1 cm FDG-avid RLL lung mass and stable bilateral hydronephrosis. MRI of the pelvis showed a 3.7 x 3.7 cm mass in the R adnexa, suspicious for metastatic disease, as well as asymmetric thickening on the posterior aspect of the bladder wall. FNA of the RP mass was positive for malignant cells. - ___: Dr. ___ cystoscopy with transurethral biopsy of the bladder mass, which showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma that was poorly differentiated, along with rare sarcomatoid features. Vaginal biopsy showed infiltrating, poorly-differentiated carcinoma, consistent with high-grade urothelial carcinoma invading the vaginal muscular wall. - ___: L-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed. - ___: UTI, treated with ciprofloxacin - ___: CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates increased size of retroperitoneal mass, along with right middle lobe lung nodule concerning for malignancy. Discussion of her case at multi-disciplinary GU Oncology Tumor Board yields consensus that this represents two separate primary malignancies. - ___: C1D1 of palliative carboplatin/gemcitabine. - ___: Admitted to ___ with UTI, treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn/Ceftriaxone/Ciprofloxacin, narrowed to Ceftriaxone and discharged to complete a course of amoxicillin. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg SC administered. - ___: C1D8 of gemcitabine held because of leukocytosis.

CT Abd ___: IMPRESSION: 1. The left nephrostomy tube is no longer present and there is new moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the left. 2. Unchanged right middle lobe lung nodule. Concerning for malignancy. 3. Retroperitoneal mass has decreased in size compared to the prior study of ___, consistent with shrinkage of the known sarcoma. 4. Unchanged thickening of the posterior wall of the bladder consistent with known malignancy

Outside records review: ___ ___ admitted for chills, nausea, L abd/flank pain. treated with antibiotics: vanc/zosyn/ceftriaxone in ED, ceftriaxone during hospitalization, discharged on amoxicillin for 7 days. urine culture grew ___ colonies pan sensitive enterococcus from voided specimen and <1000 colonies nonhemolytic strep and GNR from nephrostomy specimen.

 Brief Hospital Course: the patient was admitted to the hospital for further treatment of her complicated pyelonephritis. She was initially started on Zosyn. She had replacement of her percutaneous nephrostomy tube in interventional radiology. The tube continued to drain cloudy urine for the first day after which it cleared up. during this period she also defervesced. despite clinical improvement, urine and blood cultures showed that she was growing a resistant Pseudomonas strain. Infectious diseases was consulted and she was switched to meropenem. she was continued on this for three days. At discharge she was switched to ciprofloxacin to continue for two weeks. she feels well with complete resolution of her fevers, nausea, malaise, flank pain. During the hospitalization she had some diarrhea. C diff was tested and was negative and the diarrhea was attributed to antibiotic use.
