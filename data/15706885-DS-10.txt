 Micro: ___ Urine culture, final: negative ___ MRSA screen x 2, final: negative   Brief Hospital Course: ___ with CAD s/p MI, severe COPD (home oxygen 2.5 L), HTN, HL, MDS ___ cycle 2 ___, and bladder cancer (s/p TURBT and BCG treatment in ___ was transferred from ___ ___ with retroperitoneal bleed and is now s/p coil embolizatoin of left hypogastric artery and IVC filter placement.

In the MICU, ___ was consulted and then vascular surgery. Iliac aneurysm was found and patient transferred to vascular surgery. He was continuing to have expansion of the RP hematoma. Had CT scan at 5am on ___ which showed expansion with decompression of peritoneal cavity and his hypogastric artery was coil embolized, achieving hemostasis. The bleeding was not related to his iliac aneurysm. He was then brought to the CV ICU post-operatively. Arbitrary transfusion goal of 30 (was in 28 range before this acute illness due to MDS).

At the time of discahrge he was satting 99% on his home O2 (2L NC).  # Elevated Bicarb: Bicarb peaked at 43. Likely multifactorial due to COPD with chronic renal compensation and retention of bicarb. Also likely component of contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis. Started acetazolamide ___ through ___. Bicarb was 34 at the time of discharge. His HCO3 should continue to be monitored as long as he is being actively diuresed.  # ___ edema: Patient with continued marked lower extremity edema likely from iatrogenic volume overload due to transfusion of 10U pRBCs. He was diuresed with Lasix 20mg IV qday for the duration of his course with marked improvement in his volume overload.

The filter is a Cook Celect filter. - Patient scheduled for follow up with Hematolgoy ___ - Pt will need his Na, Cl, K, Cr and Mg checked twice daily for 3 days while being diuresed with Lasix. - Pt will need outpatient MRI/renal US to evaluate liver and renal hypodensities seen on CT  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
