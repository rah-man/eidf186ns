___ CXR (final) FINDINGS: Pacer device, and sternal wires are intact. There is evidence for prior CABG and a stent are unchanged. There is a new hazy opacity in the right lower lobe. The left lung appears predominantly clear apart from slight basilar atelectasis. The heart and mediastinal contours appear normal. No pleural effusions.   IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe opacity concerning for aspiration pneumonia. 

___: Bedside Swallow Study Mr. ___ was without overt signs of aspiration on his exam and denies recurrent aspiration event at baseline. It appears this incident is isolated and we discussed the importance of focusing on eating and reducing external distractions during meals. He can return to a PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids with meds whole with apple sauce. This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) rating of 7

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids 2. Meds whole with apple sauce 3. BID oral care 4. Please page with any further questions or concerns  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old man with history of CAD s/p CABG, aortic stenosis s/p Core Valve ___ complicated by complete heart block s/p dual chamber pacer, history of MRSA and CKD who presents from ___ rehab after witnessed aspiration event with fever, leukocytosis and evidence of aspiration pneumonia.

PROBLEM LIST: # Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient presented with leukocytosis, fevers and chills following witnessed aspiration. He did not have any cough and no sputum sample was sought. He improved rapidly with IV zosyn and vancomycin(given history of MRSA) and was quickly transitioned to oral antibiotics with levofloxacin and metronidazole for a five day course. 

He had a bedside swallow evaluation which showed normal swallowing ability. He was restarted on a thin liquid, regular consistency solid diet with medications given whole with apple sauce, which he tolerated well and should continue as an outpatient. 

# CKD: He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and is s/p lithotripsy for bladder stones with baseline Cr 1.6-1.8. His creatinine improved from 1.8 to 1.7 during his admission. His lasix was held given that he initially appeared volume down with recovery of hydration status during his hospitalization. His lasix can be restarted as an outpatient. 

# Normocytic Anemia: He was noted to have a small drop in his hematocrit over his hospitalization from 33.9 to 30.7 with universal decrease in his CBC parameters consistent with hemodilution following rehydration. Iron studies revealed a low iron level of 20 with normal TIBC/ferritin, with low iron without low ferritin levels likely secondary to acute illness. Repeat iron studies with reticulocyte count are recommended within 1 week at the long term care facility. 

# CARDIAC ISSUES: CAD s/p CABG, aortic stenosis, dual chamber pacer, HTN: He was asymptomatic and stable throughout his hospitalization. He continued to take his metoprolol,lisinopril, aspirin and plavix, with lasix to be restarted as an outpatient. 

# BPH: He has a chronic foley in place secondary to urinary retention per ___ last changed ~ 3 weeks ago. Patient pulled out his foley by accident during hospitalization, with foley replaced on ___. 

# GERD: Asymptomatic- ranitidine continued.

# Dementia: Mild, stable. Donepizil continued in house. Continue donepezil.
