REPORTS

ECGStudy Date of ___ 9:40:26 ___

Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with capture. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

Cardiac CathStudy Date of ___ 

COMMENTS:   1. Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures. The mean RA pressure was severely elevated at 17 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 19 mmHg. There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 52/19 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 36 mmHg. The mean wedge pressure was severely elevated at 22 mmHg with large V-waves to 38 mmHg. 2. The cardiac output and index as calculated by the Fick method were low-normal at 4.8 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2. 3. The PVR was mildly elevated at 233 dyne-sec/cm5.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures. 2. Large V waves on the PCWP tracing. 3. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. 4. Mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. 5. After discussion with CHF attending Dr. ___ remove PA catheter and transfer the patient to the CHF service for diuresis assisted by dobutamine.

___  Cardiovascular ECHO

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is an inferoposterobasal left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire inferior and posterior walls, and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be significantly underestimated due to technical factors). Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is tethered to the defibrillator coil. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old male with hx. CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30% in ___, CHF s/p biventricular ICD placement in ___, T2DM, PVD s/p ___ bypass grafts c/b MSSA infection presenting with c/o CHF exacerbation, trasnferred from OSH after diuresis with bumex complicated by ___.

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: EF reportedly 30% in ___. patient endorsed subacute decline in exertional capacity over last several months, starting with the death of his wife in ___. s/p attempted bumex diuresis limited by ___ Cr -> 3.8 at OSH. Right heart cath here demonstrated elevated biventricular pressure suggesting volume overload.  ECHO on ___ showed severly depressed LV function with EF 20%.  Patient was started on Lasix bolus with drip on ___ and responded well. He was symptomatically improved with diuresis.  Kidney function remained stable and Cr returned to baseline of 1.9/1.8. He was diuresed down from an admission weight of 111 kg to a discharge weight of 100.2 kg. His home lasix regimen was discontinued. He was placed on torsemide 40 mg BID and remained euvolemic on this regimen before discharge. His valsartan was also restarted and he tolerated this well. 

# Atrial flutter: patient with reported episodes of flutter to the 130s at OSH, was started on amiodarone. Given CHADS-2 score of at least 3 anticoagulation is in his favor. He was started on rivaroxaban as patient was intolerant of coumadin in the past. He will continue on aspirin and plavix as well. Patient had no further episodes of atrial flutter while in house.

# CAD: s/p CABG in ___, cath in ___ with results showing high grade disease in LMCA and RCA, patent LIMA-LAD graft, patient LIMA to OM, and patency of LCX, with occlusion of SVG to diagonal branch and RCA. Patient did not endorse chest pain on admission, EKG was unchanged and enzymes negative x3 at OSH. He was continued on carvedilol, aspirin, and plavix. IMDUR as discontinued due to low blood pressures. 

# multiple skin unclers: patient believes these are due to his MSSA bacteremia, have persisted for years since. Unclear whether they are simply due to pruritis, infection, or more significant derm process. Derm service was consulted and believed it was due to pruritis. Patient's hydroxyzne was increased to 25mg at night and he has follow-up with dermatology to continue to discuss this issue. 

# T2DM: not currently requiring insulin. Patient had actual episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH. Oral home regimen was held in house and he was placed on ISS. Wound care was consulted for right diabetic foot ulcer, which remained stable. 

# PVD: s/p right leg bypass in ___ c/b MSSA infection of graft.  Wound care was consulted for diabetic foot ulcer. Patient was continued on aspirin/plavix as well as doxycycline prophylaxis for MSSA.
