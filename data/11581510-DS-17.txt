Due to ___, held home furosemide until follow up with primary care doctor. Will follow-up as outpatient for further work-up of circumferential esophageal narrowing seen on CT.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: ====================== #COMMUNITY ACQUIRED BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA: Patient presenting with several days of shortness of breath, subjective fevers, and persistent cough with new green-yellow sputum. CURB65 of 3 (given AMS in ED, uremia, and age >___). CT Chest with bilateral lower love ___ opacities with focal mucous plugging in the left left lobe.
