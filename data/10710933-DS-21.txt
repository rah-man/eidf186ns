He was taken to an outside hospital where he was found to have a left intracranial hemorrhage. He was transferred to ___ for neurosurgery evaluation. He was initially monitored in step-down. A repeat head CT on ___ was stable, so no intervention was warranted. Given worsening weakness, he also had a repeat head CT on ___, which showed continued stability. He will need f/u with NSGY in 4 weeks. He was also found to have leukocytosis, which was likely due to stress response, as infectious workup was unrevealing. On ___, sodium was decreased to 128, which improved to 130 on discharge. He was evaluated by physical, occupational, and speech therapy and will benefit from acute rehab.

================= ACUTE ISSUES ================= #Left intracranial hemorrhage: He presents with ICH due to a fall. Repeat head CT on ___ was stable. Evaluated by neurosurgery, no surgical intervention warranted. He has dysarthria, expressive aphasia, and is diffusely weak, though symmetrically so. On ___ his functional status was noted to be worse compared to admission. A head CT was repeated which again showed no change in the bleed. He will likely benefit from acute rehab. While in the hospital, he was started on labetalol for a blood pressure goal of SBP <160 given the intracranial bleed. He should follow-up with neurosurgery in 4 weeks. 

#s/p Fall: He sustained a fall on ___. It is difficult to elicit history to help elucidate whether this was mechanical or due to underlying infection or other etiology. His sister does share that he had another fall in ___ that was mechanical in nature. He will be discharged to rehab to improve his strength. 

#Leukocytosis, due to stress response: He presented with leukocytosis to 17. This is most likely due to a stress response. He underwent workup for infection with CXR and urine culture, which did not show evidence of infection. His WBC count downtrended. 

================= CHRONIC ISSUES ================= #History of seizures: continue keppra 1000mg po BID

#HTN: Started labetalol 200mg po BID given need for improved blood pressure control due to history of ICH. 

#GERD: continued home PPI

#BPH: cont home tamsulosin

#Psychiatric issues: continued home sertraline, mirtazapine. Stopped quetiapine given tremor, rigidity, and lack of need for this medication.

================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ================= -started on labetalol for HTN, goal SBP <160 -f/u with neurosurgery in 4 weeks for repeat head CT and imaging -quetiapine was stopped, as it was not needed -please recheck electrolytes on ___ to ensure sodium level is stable #Code: DNR/DNI per MOLST #Communication: ___ (sister) ___

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ after a fall. You were found to have a bleed in your brain. You were evaluated by neurosurgery and did not need any surgery. You will be discharged to rehab to improve your strength. 

Activity We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment. You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. ___ try to do too much all at once. No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications ***Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. ***You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is important that you take this medication consistently and on time. You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.
