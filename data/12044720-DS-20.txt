 Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: ___ 06:00PM  Na 140 / K 4.6 / Cl 105 / CO2 24 / BUN 6 / Cr .6 / BG 84 WBC 9.5 / Hct 35 / Plt 493 N 66 / Bands 2 / L 14 / M 4 / B 0 INR 1.5 / PTT 26.6    Discharge Labs: ___ Na 143 / K 4.3 / Cl 108 / CO2 29 / BUN 10 / Cr .7 / BG 88 WBC 10.3 / Hct 31.1 / Plt 388 INR 1.6 / PTT 31.1  Studies: Echo ___ No echocardiographic source of embolism identified. Normal global biventricular systolic function. Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality. 

CXR ___ Right PICC tip is in the mid to lower SVC. There is mild cardiomegaly. Blunting of the right CP angle is of a long chronicity related to small pleural effusion or pleural thickening. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal interstitial abnormalities and small lung nodules are in the bases bilaterally and in the mid left lung. This is of a unknown chronicity or etiology.  Carotid US ___ Minimal atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the ICA bilaterally but without evidence of significant stenoses.  CTA Head ___ - 1. No acute intracranial process, with extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 2. Normal CTA of the head, without evidence of occlusion, or aneurysm formation. 3. Hypodensity in the suprasellar cistern could reflect normal variant. However, a pituitary microadenoma cannot be entirely excluded. If clinically indicated, this can be further evaluated with MR.   ___ ___ - Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. No previous tracing available for comparison.   

 Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ is a ___ yo woman w/ h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter and on coumadin, HTN, bronchitis who presents for cardiac work up after sudden vision loss in the right eye due to CRAO on ___.   1. Retinal artery occlusion: Unfortunately patient presented to the OSH outside treatment window for thrombolytic therapy. Per report, this retinal artery occlusion occurred while therapeutic on coumadin. In addition to the right eye vision loss, she has no other focal neuro abnormalities. Cardiac workup for source of thromboemboli was pursued at ___ and no source was identified. Lipid panel wnl, ECHO showed no PFO. ESR and CRP elevated likely due to recent pyelo, no evidence of temporal arteritis. Carotid duplex U/S showed mild athero but no significant stenosis. The formal read of her CTA demonstrated chronic ischemic changes but no acute infarct. CTA head was notable only for a hypodensity in the pituitary with further discussion below. She was monitored on telemetry without events. She was initially continued on heparin drip for subtherapeutic INR, and hematology was consulted for advice regarding appropriate target dose given thromboemboli while anticoagulated. They recommended that patient be switched from coumadin to lovenox for anticoagulation as patient appeared to have developed central retinal artery occlusion while anticoagulated. She was also continued on ASA and statin. She should be continued on lovenox therapy until she follows up with the ___ clinic. She will also need follow up with Dr. ___ at ___ in 1 month. . 2. Anemia - Patient's hct remained stable between ___. Iron studies revealed low iron, TIBC and high ferritin, consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. . 3. Recent Pyelonephritis Patient has a history of MRSA in urine at OSH and required left-sided nephrostomy tube placement. She completed course of IV vancomycin at rehab and remained asymptomatic. While at ___, she remained afebrile, asymptomatic, and her nephrostomy tube sites continued to drain clear urine. Per patient report, she has a follow-up appointment with the urology department at ___ on ___ for further evaluation of her nephrostomy tubes and for consideration of a nephrectomy. Of note, urine cultures drawn at ___ on ___ were found to have 20,000 colonies of VRE. Given that patient has remained asymptomatic, afebrile, and without leukocytosis, decision was made to not treat for this culture result.  . 4. Bronchitis - She was continued on her home regimen of flonase and cough suppressants. .  5. GERD - She was continued on her home regimen of pantoprazole. 

.  6. HTN - She was continued on her home regimen of lopressor, amlodipine, and losartan. . 7. Pituitary Abnormality Patient had CTA head to evaluate source of blood clot for retinal artery occlusion. CTA head did not demonstrate a source of clot but did note "Hypodensity in the suprasellar cistern could reflect normal variant. However, a pituitary microadenoma cannot be entirely excluded." Patient remained asymptomatic during her hospitalization, and we would recommend continued monitoring as an outpatient.

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion

Secondary: Hypertension GERD

 Discharge Condition: Stable. Patient is tolerating oral intake, has minimal vision from right eye, and has clear drainage from her left-sided nephrostomy tube site. 

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for further management after loss of vision in your right eye. At Mass Eye and Ear you were found to have a central retinal artery occlusion which caused your loss of vision. You should follow up with Dr. ___ in neuroopthamology at ___ Eye and Ear for further management ___.  While at ___, we could not find a source for your blood clot, and it appears that you have developed the blood clot while on coumadin. We have started you on a different anticoagulant called lovenox, which you should continue until you are seen in ___ clinic by Dr. ___ below).  You should follow up with your doctors at the ___ regarding your kidney.  We made the following changes to your medications: - coumadin - This medication was stopped. - lovenox - This is a new medication to help prevent further blood clots. - aspirin - This is a new medication to help prevent further blood clots.
