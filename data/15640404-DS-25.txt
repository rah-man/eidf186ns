Imaging:

___ CXR

IMPRESSION:   Small pleural effusions and mild edema. 

___ CTA IMPRESSION:   1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 2. Moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. 3. Increase size of mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease. 4. Small amount of ascites. 

___ TTE

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation (LVEF = 30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

 IMPRESSION: restrictive cardiomyopathy

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, marked deterioration of left and right ventricular function has occurred. 

___ Liver/gallbladder US

IMPRESSION:    1. Normal appearing liver without evidence of congestion or metastases. 2. Gallstones.   ___

IMPRESSION:    1. Please note the study is substantially degraded by motion, especially on postcontrast imaging. 2. Within limits of study, no definite enhancing intracranial metastasis identified. Recommend clinical correlation. If clinically indicated, consider repeat examination when patient can tolerate exam. 3. Stable findings of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.   RECOMMENDATION(S): Within limits of study, no definite enhancing intracranial metastasis identified. Recommend clinical correlation. If clinically indicated, consider repeat examination when patient can tolerate exam.   ___ Persantine MIBI

INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo woman with h/o new ischemic cardiomyopathy with s/dCHF, HTN, HLD, and IDDM was referred to the lab from the inpatient floor for evaluation. The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes. There were no reports of chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. In the setting of baseline NSSTTWs, there were no significant ST changes noted during infusion or recovery. Rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. There was an appropriate heart rate and blood pressure response to the infusion. Post-MIBI, the Persantine was reversed with 125 mg Aminophylline IV. IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately. 

IMPRESSION: Fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall.  Globally reduced wall motion both at rest and stress. These findings are both new compared to prior study, which was normal. 

Micro: none

Pathology:

___: cytology negative for malignant

Imaging remarkable for bilateral pleural effusions and increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A diagnosis acute onset CHF with new reduced EF of 30% was made. 

# Hypoxia: Secondary to pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which seem to be related to CHF based on EF and transudative nature of the pleural effusions. No e/o pneumonia or PE based on negative CTA. -Diuresed to euvolemia -s/p bilateral Chest tube placement and removal -Pleural fluid cytology negative for malignancy, cultures NGTD -Wean O2 as tolerated: patient asymptomatic but occasionally desatted to the high 80's when walking on room air.

# Systolic CHF secondary to cardiomyopathy: Patient with worsening CHF based on TTE with EF of 30%. Had known NSTEMI related to recent surgical resection with known history of PVD s/p left SFA intervention and risk factors including smoking history, HTN, HLD and diabetes. Per cards, likely a cardiomyopathy that will need further work-up. Persantine mibi showed a fixed wall motion abnormality as well as abnormalities worsening with stress. -Metoprolol XL 50 -Lisinopril 5 mg -Ensure dry weight of ~120 lbs, -Continue atorvastatin -Continue aspirin and Plavix -D/C'd cilostazol for concerns of CHF exacerbation -Outpatient followup

No e/o hemolysis Iron studies consistent with iron deficiency with low iron/TIBC ratio (<10%). -Started ferrous sulfate 325mg daily, uptitrate as tolerated

# Transaminitis: Patient has elevated ALT/AST/ALP with increased DBili. RUQ ultrasound without abnormalities. Given downtrending with drainage of effusions and diuresis, suspect this is secondary to hepatic congestion, now improving with euvolemia. -Treatment of CHF as above

#Tremor/Asterixis: Suggestive of toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Patient has noticed some tremor when holding her food menu, no issue with tremor when holding fork or eating. CN II-XII intact, minimal dysmetria. Not clear association with rest or intention. Does have asterixis without evidence of overt liver or kidney disease. Appears to be improving -Ammonia, TSH WNL. LFTs improving. -MRI head w/wo contrast; no evidence of new metastasis

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for weeks of fatigue which led to a finding of a low oxygen level in the emergency department. It was discovered that your heart was not pumping as well and fluid had backed up into your lungs. We helped take off this fluid with medication as well as two chest tubes. 

The cause of your fatigue and low oxygen was thought to be due to a new reduction in the pump function of your heart. Further testing did not reveal an area to intervene on with a procedure. We will treat this with medications and suggest follow-up with an outpatient cardiologist. 

Please take all your medications as prescribed and attend all your follow-up appointments. It was a pleasure to take care of you here at ___.

Please weigh yourself daily and if you gain 3 lbs or more, please call your doctor. 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
