 History of Present Illness: ___ year old female nonischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20%, hypertension, mitral valve prolapse with severe MR, left bundle-branch block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates, and VF arrest s/p BiV ICD placement ___, multiple recent admits for CHF presenting with concern for AICD firing x2.  . The patient reports her current symptoms began on ___, 4 days prior to presentation when she began experiencing episodes of palpitations lasting up to 4 hours. The palpitations were similar to prior episodes she had experienced in the past due to her afib and she was unconcerned at that time. She denies experiencing chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting, but does report a headache and feeling off-balance, which she has not felt with prior episodes of palpitations. She was asymptomatic the day prior to presentation. The night of presentation, approximately 2 hours prior to presentation at 3am, she was woken from sleep due to her AICD firing. She reports nausea after the first ICD shock, and was sitting up when she experienced a second shock 10 minutes later. She denies prodromes of chest pain, lightheadedness, dyspnea, or plapitations prior to the second shock. She presented to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies recent vomiting, chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, recent weight gain, pedal edema. She denies headache, vision changes, numbness/tingling, focal weakness, abdominal pain. . Of note, the patient has a complicated cardiac history which started with longstanding non-ischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in ___ (outlined below). She had been doing well with fluctuating EF and LV function but without symptoms until ___, when she reported mild dyspnea with climbing stairs and no symptoms when walking on flat ground. She also reported dyspnea and occasional palpitations in late ___ ___ in the setting of eating more salt while dining out, but attributed this to humidity. . The patient was seen in the ED ___ for CHF and was diuresed with IV Lasix in the ED per Cardiology consult recs prior to discharge with f/u. She saw her PCP ___ ___ for dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, but reported no pedal edema, weight gain, dietary indiscretion, or chest pain. She subsequently saw Dr. ___ outpatient cardiologist, on ___ and her HCTZ and Spironolactone were both decreased to half tablets daily.  She was found to be in new onset afib and was started on Warfarin. Her blood pressure was also lower than baseline and they had discussed a stepwise transition from Metoprolol succinate to Carvedilol 6.25 mg daily and the addition of Spironolactone 3.125 mg daily. She had titrated to Metoprolol 50 mg daily and Carvedilol 3.12 mg daily but began experiencing progressive dyspnea with minimal exertion, PND, orthopnea, intermittent palpitations, and pedal edema on ___. She denied any chest pain or lightheadedness.  . She presented to the ED on ___ and was admitted for a CHF exacerbation and was diuresed with Lasix. She was in atrial fibrillation and underwent ___ with DCCV on ___ and was started on Dofetilide (INR was subtherapeutic as Coumadin was started 5 days prior to admission). Unfortunately, she subsequently was noted to have QT prolongation and developed torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. She was defibrillated and was transferred to the CCU where electrolytes were aggressively repleted with resolution of QTc. She continued to be in afib and had an bi-V pacer/ICD placed on ___ with LV lead revision on ___, and was loaded on Amiodarone and rate controlled with Metoprolol. She was also started on Aspirin 81 daily and discharged on Lasix. . The patient presented to the ED on ___fter walking into a marble table at 2am, and was subsequently cleared and discharged. She was scheduled to undergo outpatient DCCV on ___ but this was rescheduled in the setting of subtherapeutic INR and unwillingness to undergo TEE. She was planned to continue a three week course of amiodarone 200mg TID until ___ and then start amiodarone 200mg daily. She was switched to Dabigatran 150 mg bid. Following her discharge, she experienced intermittent dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and head pressure with stable 1 pillow orthopnea and baseline PND. She called her cardiologist on ___ for these symptoms and her Dagibatran was discontinued and she was switched back to Warfarin. Aspirin had been discontinued, and Lasix was being adjusted based on voiding for unclear reasons (her cardiologist had not been aware of Lasix changes).

On ___, she was seen by Dr. ___ noted to be BiV paced only 8%, is RV paced at 80 bpm 54%. She complained of dyspnea without chest pain, lightheadedness, or palpitations, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR with lower than baseline blood pressure. Her Metoprolol was decreased to 100 mg daily and continued on Amiodarone. Re-starting digoxin was considered. Lisinopril was decreased due to her blood pressure and Spironolactone was held.

She called on ___ with complaints of dyspnea, nausea/vomiting x1, and pedal edema, and was referred to the ED, where she was admitted for CHF exacerbation. She did note eating out more often rather than cooking at home, but did not report medication non-compliance. She also noted home blood pressure readings in the 70's-80's systolic. She was diuresed 8 lbs on a Lasix drip, which was switched to Torsemide prior to discharge. Her Lisinopril was decreased to 2.5 mg daily prior to discharge and her Spironolactone was restarted at 12.5 mg daily. Her weight on discharge was 143 lbs, and her dry weight is ~139 lbs. EP had recommended cardioversion but the patient refused, as it had been ineffective in the past. She was discharged on Digoxin, Amiodarone 200 daily, and Metoprolol was increased to 200 mg daily. Following discharge, she most recently saw Dr. ___ ___ in clinic on ___ and was rescheduled for TEE and cardioversion. Digoxin was increased to 0.125 mg daily at that visit for better rate control. Unfortunately, she developed her symptoms outlined above and returned to the ED today for her AICD firing. . In the ED, initial vitals were 97.5 73 136/96 20 96% RA The patient had no further epsidoes of AICD firing and denied chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea in the ED. EKG showed paced rhythm without evidence of ischemia, and telemetry reportedly showed occasional unifocal PVCs. EP was consulted and interrogated her pacemaker, which showed multiple episodes of fast VT and polymorphic VT in the past two days which were non-sustained, terminated with ATP, or defibrillated. The patient given Digoxin 0.125 mg, Amiodarone 200 mg, Lisinopril 5 mg, Metoprolol XL 100 mg, Torsemide 20 mg, Acetaminophen 650 mg for a headache. She was admitted to cardiology for further evaluation. Vitals on transfer were 97.4 60 16 108/55 98% RA . On arrival to the floor, patient denies any symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, nausea, palpitations. She had no other complaints.  Past Medical History: 1.

She was medically managed. Repeat ___ ___ showed slight improvement of LV dilation and EF (<25%).  ___, ___ showed EF 35-40, TR gradient 21. On ___, ___ showed EF 50%, TR gradient 33-37, moderate MR. ___ had a repeat stress test in ___ on a modified ___ protocol for 7.5 minutes with EF 50%, no new perfusion defects, no LBBB. ___ in ___ showed EF 40%, TR gradient ___, mild-to-moderate MR and she underwent a stress test which showed LBBB at rest, EF ___, no evidence of ischemia or symptoms. On ___, ___ showed EF 40-45%, TR gradient <20, mild global LV hypokinesis, normal regional function, mild-to-moderate MR ___ to findings in ___. Repeat stress echo in ___ showed worsened EF ___, LBBB at rest, TR gradient 30, normal IVC, normal RA pressure, inferior lateral hypo to akinesis (more prominent regional dysfunction compared to ___. However, repeat ___ on this admission showed improvement of LV function with EF 40% and improved MR. ___ patient was asymptomatic for anginal symptoms with negative CE's and no EKG changes, and she was continued on her home Aspirin 81 mg daily for primary prevention. . #. Hypertension: Patient has history of difficult to control hypertension on high doses of anti-hypertensives and also complicated by a history of orthostatic hypotension. BP was fairly well controlled in-house, and she was continued on her home regimen of Metoprolol, Lisinopril, and Spironolactone. . #. Dyslipidemia: Patient has recent elevated LDL in the 140's and mylagia with statins. Given a prior cardiac MRI had shown no CAD and her stress tests have been negative for ischemia, she has been managed with weight loss and lifestyle modifications.  Fish oil, omega-3-fatty acids had been discussed and she has fish oil pills at home but had not been taking them consistently. She was started in-house on fish oil 1 gm bid for her dyslipidemia, and counseled on continuing this as an outpatient. . #. Pulmonary hypertension: Stable, no dyspnea. Potential indication for outpatient sleep study given progressive pulmonary hypertension and history of snoring when sleeping. . .
