On ___, the patient experienced confusion, new-onset left facial droop, as well as weakness/numbness in RUE/RLE. He was taken to ___, where MRI revealed right occipital lobe lesion. Afterwards, CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed, and it revealed a questionable nodule in his right thorax between the ___ and 3rd ribs; node was not palpable on exam at this time. Because he was currently on ___, biopsy of brain lesion or chest lesion was not performed at this time. His motor/sensory symptoms resolved on their own over the next few days (with only mild confusion remaining), and the patient was discharged from ___ on ___ with instructions to follow up.

Through the next couple weeks, aside from brief lapses in judgment while performing everyday activities, the patient had returned close to baseline and able to walk with a walker. He began tapering off ___ on ___ in prep of his biopsy; taper was completed on ___. Patient states that, per cardiologist, he can stop ___ permanently from here on out. 

Suddenly, yesterday morning (___), the patient had difficulty getting out of bed, was very fatigued and confused, and felt weakness in his left arm/foot.

Brief Hospital Course: ___ is an ___ man with newly diagnosed right occipital CNS lymphoma (___), who presents with 1-day history of fatigue, confusion, and left-sided weakness.

1. Right Occipital CNS Lymphoma: As shown by CT from OSH, tumor has progressed in 2 week span. Patient had new symptoms of mild LUE/LLE weakness and partial left-sided hemianopsia. MRI w/contrast performed on ___ revealed a 5.0 x 4.1 x 3.0 cm homogeneously enhancing lesion in the right posterior parietal, occipital and medial temporal lobes extending into the right side of the splenium of the corpus callosum along with a few satellite nodules and moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, increased since the recent study of ___. In addition, a small 1.7 cm enhancing nodule in the right frontal scalp soft tissues was seen. Neurosurgery performed CT-guided biopsy of the right-sided occipital lesion on ___. Patient did well during procedure, no complications, frozen specimen looked like lymphoma. Patient was started on Decadron 4Q6 afterwards. Head CT postop showed "Expected appearance status post right occipital mass biopsy. Only a small focus of hemorrhage is identified within the lesion." After procedure, SBP was kept under 140. ___ restarted 24h postoperatively. On ___, patient was transferred to Neuro-Oncology service (Dr. ___ for chemotherapy. He successfully underwent his first cycle of methotrexate therapy under Dr. ___ care as an inpatient. He tolerated the therapy well with very minimal side effects. He was evaluated by ___ and was discharged home to return the following week for his second cycle.

2. Acute Kidney Insufficiency: Patient underwent his cycle of methotrexate chemotherapy as an inpatient. He was hydrated with a bicarbonate infusion continuously to alkalinize his urine for his methotrexate therapy. His initial creatinine of 1.2 on admission was elevated to 1.4 the day after receiving his first dose of methotrexate. It uptrended and stabilized at 1.8 for three days on day of discharge. A calculate FeNA was 18%, indicating intrinsic renal injury likely due to methotrexate. His urine output remained sufficient given he was adequately hydrated with IV fluids and his own po intake was sufficient. It was expected that his Cr would normalize back to baseline once his methotrexate cycle ended and he was encouraged to maintain adequate hydration at home. His chemistry panel will be monitored as an outpatient on followup.
