MICROBIOLOGY: ================ Blood culture x2 ___ - NGTD

IMAGING: ========================== CT Abd/Pelvis ___ 1. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 2. Bowel wall thickening and surrounding stranding involving a loop of small bowel in the left lower quadrant may represent mild enteritis. 3. Complex right renal cystic lesion and multiple hyperdense lesions in the bilateral kidneys should be further evaluated with MRI or multiphasic CT to exclude malignancy in this hemodialysis patient. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with PMHx of diverticulitis, C.Diff, ESRD on HD presenting with LLQ abdominal pain and findings of small bowel enteritis in LLQ on abdominal CT, most likely consistent with viral enteritis. Patient had just completed course of antibiotics (cipro/flagyl) and did not have fever, leukocytosis or worsening symptoms therefore antibiotics were discontinued. Patient tolerated advancing diet without worsening symptoms. She was pain free and tolerating regular diet on day of discharge. Additionally, patient was restarted on outpatient regimen of psyllium and cholestyramine on day of discharge. 

#LLQ Abdominal Pain: Patient was recently evaluated at ___ ___ 2 weeks prior to admission and found to have ileitis on CT, started on course of ciprofloxacin and flagyl. Patient presented to ___ with LLQ pain, CT showed evidence of diverticulosis without diverticulitis, LLQ enteritis. As patient did not have fevers, leukocytosis, and had recently completed a full course of cipro and flagyl, this was thought to be a viral enteritis and no further antibiotics administered. Patient was noted to have elevated lipase, uptrending to 433, concerning for pancreatitis, however this diagnosis was thought to be less likely given location of pain, lack of symptoms with PO intake, lack of imaging findings, and unclear etiology (non-drinker, previous cholecystectomy, no new medications). Blood cultures no growth to date. Patient's pain improved and she was able to tolerate a full diet prior to discharge. 

#Diarrhea: Patient has history of c diff colitis as well as chronic diarrhea which is generally well controlled on psyllium. She began experiencing loose bowel movements in the week preceeding admission. During admission diarrhea improved, and patient began having one bowel movement per day. Home psyllium and cholestyramine were initially held and then restarted on the day of discharge. Low clinical suspicion for C. diff given lack of leukocytosis, improving symptoms, no imaging findings.

#Acute-on-chronic Anemia: Patient chronically anemic with Hb ___ during previous admissions. Hgb downtrended from 11.7 on presentation to 10.0 during admission. Rectal exam showed guaiac negative brown stool. Etiology thought likely anemia of chronic disease (elevated ferritin at previous visits) with downtrend being dilutional given decreased WBC, platelet counts. 

#ESRD: Patient was maintained on ___ dialysis through LUE AVF throughout admission. Had HD session here at ___ on ___. Continued calcium acetate, nephrocaps.

CHRONIC ISSUES: #Dementia: Son reports progressive dementia over last several years that has been evaluated as an outpatient. Patient A&Ox2, able to determine hospital and year from multiple choices. At baseline mental status. During admission, maintained frequent reorientation to prevent delirium. No clinical signs of delirium during admission.

Chronic Issues:  # HTN: Previously on amlodipine, hydral and carvedilol in ___. Now only on carvedilol. Carvedilol held during admission due to low-normal pressures.

# HLD: Continued pravastatin 10mg PO daily, ASA 81mg. 

# Paroxysmal Afib: History of Afib during hospitalization in ___. Was not anticoagulated long-term due to a questionable hematoma on heparin gtt. Converted to regular sinus rhythm afterwards. Has not had previous Holter monitoring done. CHADS2Vasc = 4 (HTN, Age ___, was continued on ASA 81 mg throughout admission. Consider holter monitor as outpatient to determine burden of atrial fibrillation. 

==================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ===================== [] Right renal cystic lesion and multiple hyperdense lesions in bilateral kidneys: seen on CT, recommend MRI or multiphasic CT to exclude malignancy in this hemodialysis patient. [] History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- CHADS2Vasc score =4, consider outpatient holter ___ of hearts to evaluate for burden of afib (patient appeared to be in sinus rhythm throughout this admission). []ESRD- Maintained on ___ dialysis schedule, had session of HD ___, due ___. Continued home calcium acetate, nephrocaps. [] HTN: Home carvedilol held during admission due to low-normal pressures (SBP ___. will need to be restarted at PCP follow up or before if BPs tolerate. [] Decreased Vision: Patient complained of long standing difficulty with vision, L>R, consider referral to optometry for formal vision testing
