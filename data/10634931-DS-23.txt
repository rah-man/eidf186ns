She tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the PACU in stable condition post-operatively. In the PACU her blood pressure on cuff was noted to be low; the upper extremity arterial line was also low with systolic BP <60. The patient was, however, asymptomatic, A&Ox3 with adequate urine output and HR 70's. A blood pressure cuff was placed on her leg and demonstrated a BP about 40 points higher than the arm cuff. It was determined that she likely had bilateral subclavian stenosis and that UE pressures were unreliable. However, due to bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts, lower extremity blood pressures were avoided unless warranted due to change in patient's clinical status.

She was brought to the VICU in stable condition and did well post-operatively. Pain was well controlled and the graft remained palpable. On POD1 she was advanced to a regular diet, pain remained well controlled and she was hemodynamically stable. She was restarted on her home insulin regimen, foley was removed at midnight. Bypass dressings were removed on POD3 in accordance with the silver trial. She was restarted on her home blood pressure medications and remained hemodynamically stable. Physical therapy was consulted and worked with the patient on POD3 and POD4, and she was cleared for home with home physical therapy.

On POD5 she is in good condition, ambulating, tolerating a general diet, on home medications including coumadin, and hemodynamically stable. She is discharged home with services.
