 History of Present Illness: HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ___ is a ___ PMH HFpEF, inferior MI, HTN, HLD, CAD (no stents), PVD s/p peripheral stents, bilateral renal artery stenosis s/p stenting in ___, ?multisystem atrophy who presented to clinic with dyspnea on exertion and peripheral edema. His home Furosemide dose had been increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily with some improvement in his edema, but no improvement in his dyspnea. As a result the decision was made for him to have a R and LHC for further workup.

He presented today for a planned outpatient L and RHC. He was found to have multivessel disease non amenable to PCI, felt not to be good CABG candidate so doing medical management. R sided pressures up, also wheezing throughout procedure. RHC numbers - RA 18, RV 60/20, PCWP 38, mPAP 42. Had right radial access.  On arrival to the floor he says that he is not having any CP, arm pain, jaw pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. He is endorsing SOB and cough. He says that the SOB actually feels better when he lies down.  Past Medical History: 1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS  - Hypertension  - Dyslipidemia  2. CARDIAC HISTORY  - EF 62%  3.

============================= PERTINENT RESULTS ============================= IMAGING/STUDIES ============================= CARDIAC CATH: ___ 1. Severe 3 vessel CAD (see description) 2. Markedly elevated L and R sided fillling pressures with low normal mcardiac index. Severe pulmonary hypetension with only minimally elevated PVR. Recommendations 1. He is not a good candidate for CABG based on clinical history. PCI options might include attempted CTO of RCA and then consider PCI of LAD (diffuse area for stenting) and stent of D1/Ramus. This would be complex and is dependent on successful CTO. For now he requires treatment for heart failure before consideration of PCI. === CXR ___ IMPRESSION: Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___. Lung volumes are lower with more basal atelectasis and crowding of pulmonary vasculature that might obscure mild pulmonary edema. Mediastinal veins are but not overly engorged.  Heart is partially obscured by the elevated diaphragm, but not massive. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. === Lower extremity US ___ No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity veins. === Chest CT ___ IMPRESSION: Bibasilar, dependent atelectasis. Otherwise no acute intrathoracic abnormality. === Neck CT ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Fluid surrounding the endotracheal tube in the subglottic region. No evidence of airway narrowing or obstruction. 2. Please refer to separate report of CT chest performed on the same day for description of the thoracic findings. === CXR ___. No pneumonia. 2. New mild right lower lobe atelectasis. 3. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis, improved. 4. Small left pleural effusion. === TTE ___ Very suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (posterobasal segment may be hypokinetic or akinetic). Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.The mitral regurgitation is almost certainly significantly underestimated due to eccentric nature of flow as well as very suboptimal image quality. TEE recommended for better assessment if clinically indicated.

His hospital course was complicated by acute hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, Klebsiella pneumonia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

================= ACTIVE ISSUES ================= # Acute hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient presented with dyspnea after elective cardiac catheterization showing elevated right-sided filling pressures. He was initially admitted to the cardiology service, where was diuresed. However, his dyspnea persisted and he developed an inspiratory stridor so he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he was intubated. Bronchoscopy was performed that showed significant expiratory airway collapse consistent with tracheobronchomalacia. Bronchial washings grew Klebsiella, and the patient was treated with a 5-day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He failed his first attempt at extubation due to inspiratory stridor. He was given steroids to treat airway edema and was successfully extubated on the second attempt. By day of discharge, he was saturation well and breathing comfortably on room air.

#Acute on chronic HFpEF: Last TTE ___ showed preserved EF (62%). RHC showed elevated filling pressures with RA 18, RV 60/20, PCWP 38, mPAP 42, consistent with volume overload. He was diuresed to euvolemia and restarted on furosemide 40 mg daily. Discharge weight: 79.4 kg. 

#Klebsiella pneumonia: As above, BAL grew Klebsiella and the patient was treated with a course of ceftriaxone and azithromcyin.

#CAD: Patient underwent left and right cardiac catheterization that showed three-vessel disease and elevated right-sided filling pressures. He was deemed to be a poor candidate for CABG. Medical management of his coronary artery disease was continued with aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. He will follow up with his outpatient cardiologist to continue optimal medical management, and to discuss any possible interventions such as high-risk PCI.

#Atrial fibrillation: Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation during this admission. He was started on metoprolol and apixaban.

#Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: Patient was given steroids for inspiratory stridor and airway edema, resulting in hyperglycemia. He was given insulin to treat this. His blood sugars are expected to normalize after discontinuation of steroids, and the insulin may be discontinued at that time.

___: Creatinine on presentation was 1.2, rose to a peak of 1.7, and was 1.3 on day of discharge. Thought to be multifactorial, with contributions from contrast nephropathy and cardiorenal syndrome. Acute on chronic congestive heart failure was managed as above.

================= CHRONIC ISSUES ================= #Urinary retention: Patient performs intermittent straight catheterizations at home for urinary retention secondary to BPH. #OSA: Continued home BIPAP.

===================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ===================== - Discharge weight: 79.4 kg  - Discharge creatinine: 1.3 - Please weigh patient every day. Contact cardiologist if weight increases by more than 3 pounds. Discharged on Lasix 40 mg daily; this may require uptitration. - Patient discharged on insulin sliding scale for treatment of steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Insulin should be discontinued when blood sugars normalize. - The patient should use BiPAP at night and has needed for stridor and dyspnea related to his tracheobronchomalacia. - New medications: aspirin, apixaban, metoprolol - Patient to follow up with cardiology to discuss medical management of CAD and consideration of high-risk PCI; HFpEF; and atrial fibrillation - Patient to follow up with pulmonology to discuss new diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia - Communication: Son (___)  - Code: Full  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation. 1.
