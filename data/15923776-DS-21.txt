 History of Present Illness: ___ female with history of chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, and dementia was admitted from the ED with shortness of breath and found to have pneumonia per ED report.

CXR ___ - fluid overload  Brief Hospital Course: It was felt the patient was essentially at her baseline, per conversation with daughter who saw patient, and pt's PCP.  Although clinically she was not in acute failure, the crackles on exam are undoubtedly from chronic sCHF and CXR suggested volume overloaded state. I discussed case in detail with Dr. ___ and daughter and we decided it was not in interest of patient to pursue CT of chest, and to manage pt's status as an outpatient. She has been managing crackles and lower extremity edema for some time. Patient is not on daily ACE nihibitor or lasix at baseline and I think prn lasix would be best solution given risk of hypotension. Pt has prn O2 at home during day, and standing O2 at night. She was 92%RA here, and 97% with O2.

Her other home meds were continued. Antibiotics were not continued even though she was given in the ED as there is not overwhelming evidence for a pneumonia - no fever, no hypoxemia, no clear dyspnea or chest pain, no leukocytosis, and she had received 7 doses of Levo already.

All labs stable. BCx was NGTD on discharge
