Pre-operatively, she was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained, all other preparations were made.  It was decided that she would undergo:  OPERATIONS: 1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral   artery. 2. Contralateral third-order catheterization of the right   anterior tibial artery. 3. Serial arteriogram of the right lower extremity. 4. Balloon angioplasty of the right common femoral artery   to the anterior tibial artery vein bypass graft. 5. Balloon angioplasty of the right anterior tibial artery. 6.

Prepped, and brought down to the endo suite room for surgery. Intra-operatively, was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable. Tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complications.  Post-operatively, transferred to the PACU for further stabilization and monitoring.  Was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While in the VICU, received monitored care. When stable was delined. Diet was advanced.   When stabilized from the acute setting of post operative care, was then transferred to floor status.  On the floor, remained hemodynamically stable with pain controlled.
