Final Report EXAMINATION: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD   INDICATION: ___ man fell out of bed. Evaluate for acute intracranial process.   TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained without contrast.   DOSE:  This study involved 3 CT acquisition phases with dose indices as follows:   1) CT Localizer Radiograph   2) CT Localizer Radiograph   3) Sequenced Acquisition 16.0 s, 16.9 cm; CTDIvol = 47.4 mGy (Head) DLP = 802.7 mGy-cm.  Total DLP (Head) = 803 mGy-cm.   COMPARISON: Noncontrast CT head ___.   FINDINGS:   There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  Hypodensity within the left frontal lobe is related to prior tumor resection. The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy. Confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities likely represent the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is a left frontal burr hole. The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells clear. There is cerumen in the right external auditory canal. The left external auditory canals clear The visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. Small right frontal scalp hematoma.   IMPRESSION:    1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Small right frontal scalp hematoma. .
