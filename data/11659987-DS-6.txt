 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: ___  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, thalamic bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: ___ M with recent right thalamic cerebellar bleed, chronic c.diff colitis, h/o aspiration s/p PEG came to ER from rehab after fall 3 days ago and subsequent headache. He went to ___ where he was found to have saturation in ___. CXR showed aspiration, CTH showed "acute posterior right corona radiata intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect" unclear if this was acute or chronic. He was then transferred. Here CT shows right thalamic bleed, unclear if acute or chronic without seeing prior image. Neurosurgery saw patient, no surgical indication. Neurology saw patient and rec holding lovenox, ASA, dilantin and getting films from ___ bleed, MRI if becomes stable. Patient was confirmed DNR/DNI. CXR confirms right aspiration PNA and right clavicle fracture. He was given 1.5 L NS and placed on NRB with saturations 92-96%. ECG with SR, TW flat V5 V6 and no acute ST-T changes.  In the ER vitals 92/48, was ___ systolic briefly, HR ___, NRB 100% with sats 92-96%  .  Review of sytems:  (+) Per HPI 

 Past Medical History: Right thalamic hemorrhage, diagnosed ___  Chronic C. difficile colitis on daily vancomycin  Aspiration s/p PEG ___ c/b aspiration PNA  Bilateral DVT, previously on Coumadin  CAD  Hypertension  AAA s/p repair  Cervical spinal stenosis  History of lumbar disc surgery  Left cataract surgery 

 Social History: ___ Family History: There is no family history of hypertension, DM, stroke. His father had lung cancer and was a smoker.  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2:  General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress  HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear  Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD  Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi  CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops  Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly  Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema 

 Pertinent Results: ___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right sided parenchymal opacities have massively increased in extent. They now occupy the entire right lung bases. The presence of a combined dense lung parenchyma and air bronchograms suggests pneumonia. Mild increase in density is also seen at the left lung bases. The presence of a small right-sided effusion cannot be excluded, no larger left-sided pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Round linear structure in the left lung base is caused by a skin fold. 

___ CT Head: Right thalamic hemorrhage. Given the report of this having occurred on ___, without comparison study, cannot assess whether this appearance represents evolution of that hemorrhage or re-bleed. Recommend re-evalution when previous (OSH) study becomes available, or short-interval f/u study. 

___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right-sided PICC line is in unchanged position with tip in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Diffuse right sided parenchymal opacities and a small right-sided pleural effusion are not significantly changed. A new opacity in the left lung base representing a developing consolidation possibly secondary to aspiration. There is a left sided small pleural effusion as well.    

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man w/ recent thalamic hemorrhage likely secondary to combination of supratheraputic INR and hypertension admitted with altered mental status and hypoxia likely due to aspiration pneumonia. 

1) Aspiration pneumonia: He had a witnessed aspiration event immediately prior to becoming hypoxic and confused. CXR demonstrated a large RLL infiltrate consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He was initially treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin and zosyn was added on ___ for expanded coverage of hospical acquired aspiration pneumonia because his improvement was slow. His respiratory function gradually improved and his supplemental oxygen requirement decreased. Levofloxacin was also discontinued. A PICC line was also placed to facilitate IV antibiotics, and he will complete a 10-day course of vancomycin on ___ and zosyn on ___. He was also given albuterol, ipratropium, and budesonide nebulizer treatments to help his oxygenation and ventilation, and to treat likely COPD given his extensive smoking history. Aspiration precautions were also taken, including keeping the head of bed elevated to 30 degrees at all times. He was also continued on tube feeds.

2)Right thalamic bleed: He suffered a CVA in his right thalamus on ___ that was thought to be secondary to hypertension and an elevated INR. He was on warfarin for a DVT that was diagnosed in ___. After he was stabilized (INR was corrected and patient was monitored to assess for resolution of bleed), he was started on ASA 325 mg daily and Lovenox 40 SC daily. He was then discharged to ___ ___, where he fell and hit his head on ___. He was complaining of a headache, however, and was readmitted for evaluation. At this time, there was concern that the patient may have had a recurrent bleed but his CT head was stable x 2.  Lovenox was stopped nonetheless. Heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis was continued.

3) Right fractured clavicle/Left chest pain: The patient was placed in a sling and will need to follow-up appointment with orthopedics as an outpatient. His left chest pain was secondary to costochondritis and was managed with tylenol and ibuprofen.

4) C.diff colitis: He has had recurrent c. diff and has been on a long taper with recent recurrence of cdiff after stopping po vanco.  He was continued on po vancomycin and will need a long taper after abx course completed.

5) h/o DVT: Diagnosed in ___ and treatment was stopped after his thalamic bleed, as described above, and then restarted with lovenox. He has completed approximately six months of anticoagulation. A hypercoagulability evaluation has not been performed, however. 

6) CAD/HTN: Continued on lopressor, ASA, and lisinopril.

7)FEN: Fibersource HN (Full) - ___ 05:07 ___ 40 mL/hour

8)Access: PICC placed ___: SQ UF Heparin, PPI

10) Code status: DNR/DNI. We had a long discussion with family and they would not want CVL, a-line, or other aggresive therapies.
