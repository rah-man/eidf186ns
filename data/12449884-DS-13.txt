Intraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type. Leftward axis. ST-T wave abnormalities. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

___ CXR: Right internal jugular line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction. Mediastinal fullness in the region of the ascending aorta right lower paratracheal region could be due to vascular distention alone but central adenopathy should be considered. Mild left basal atelectasis and possible mild interstitial abnormality at the right base are the only focal pulmonary abnormalities. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. 

___ CXR: Borderline interstitial edema is present and the heart size though normal has increased while mediastinal vasculature is mildly distended, but the major change since ___ is a worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis which is probably responsible for hypoxia. Dr. ___ Dr. ___ paged to report these findings at the time of dictation. 

___ CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is again mild prominence of vascular markings consistent with slight elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. Increased opacification persists at the left base consistent with some combination of atelectasis and effusion. A catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC. IVC filter is again seen. Little overall change 

___ B/L ___: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.
