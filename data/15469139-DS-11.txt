Chief Complaint: Tracheocutaneous fistula  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___: Excision of tracheocutaneous fistula with V-Y plasty layered closure.

 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is an ___ female well known to me after a complicated admission due to a motor vehicle crash last year.  She ultimately had a left thyroid lobectomy as well as an open tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She spent a considerable amount of time in the hospital and has subsequently had a long rehab stay and is now thankfully at home. Her prior open tracheostomy performed by Dr. ___ was removed, now over five months ago. In that time, the stoma has failed to close and now has a well-epithelialized tract. She asks for closure as it is significantly impacting her life.  A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of surgery was had with the patient and she ultimately consented to proceed.  Of note, she does have a significant cardiac history and was evaluated by Cardiology prior to the procedure and her Eliquis has been held for greater than 48 hours prior to surgery.
