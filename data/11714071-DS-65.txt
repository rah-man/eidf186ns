 Brief Hospital Course: Summary:

___ year old woman with multiple medical problems including CAD, DVT s/p IVC filter, and anxiety presents five days after a recent discharge with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting that she attributes to starting Effexor.

Active Problems:  # Abdominal pain: Had some vomiting and diarrhea upon arrival to the floor which was self limited and improved on the same day, likely gastroenteritis. She had an elevated WBC count for one day which also resolved and was likely a stress response. CT abdomen showed no acute intraabdominal process. She did not have a bowel movement after her first day in the hospital, and constipation may have been contributing to her abdominal pain. The patient refused an enema or miralax to help with her constipation. Of note she has had previous admissions with similar complaints and on her last (recent) admission she was seen by psychiatry who felt that many of her complaints were psychosomatic. She appeared anxious throughout her hospital stay although she denied being anxious and refused to take Effexor or consider other psychopharmacological interventions. 

#Urinary Tract Colonization - Yeast has been present chronically and represents colonization. She had multiple urine cultures grow yeast on this admission, however denied symptoms of urge, burning, itching or frequency. One culture on this admission grew 10,000-100,000 GNR's however the final results showed this to be consistent with fecal contamination.  She was not treated for a UTI. 

#Urinary retention - She has a history of chronic urinary retention, and needs a foley or else straight cath BID, but since she cannot straight cath herself and does not have help at home, a foley is in place. She has the foley changed by ___ every 6 weeks. During her admission her foley was changed after an initial urine culture was growing GNR's, and repeat culture grew only yeast.  She should follow up for this problem with urology.

# Anxiety: Needs more support at home. Per psych consult on her last admission she has significant somatization and GAD is likely although the patient denies that she is anxiuos. She has not tried effexor for long enough to see if she will benefit from it, and it seems unlikely that she is allergic to it. She believes she is "allergic to everything". She would benefit from outpatient treatment for anxiety, however it appears unlikely that she will agree to it. 

#Deconditioning Patient is refusing ___ at home. Per ___ she is at her baseline now and walks with a walker. She may benefit from more frequent ___ visits at home if she continues to refuse ___.

#Diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled: Last A1c ___ was 8.1. She was put on glargine with SSI and sugars were well controlled.

Inactive Issues: # GERD: continued on omeprazole  # HTN: continued on ticlodipine  # Chronic pain: continue gabapentin  # Coronary artery disease: dobutamine stress ___ which was negative for inducible ischemia.  We deferred alteration of her medications given large allergy list and long history of care from cardiology. She was continued on her home simvastatin

Transitional Issues: #Abdominal Pain - she will follow up with her PCP for this. No dangerous cause was found - it was likely viral gastroenteritis compounded by anxiety. 

#Urinary retention - she will get ___ services to change her foley and will follow up with urology.  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR. 1. Gabapentin 300 mg PO DAILY 2. Gabapentin 100 mg PO HS 3. Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY 4. Ticlopidine HCl 250 mg PO BID 5.
