PERTINENT IMAGING: ================== ___ CXR: COPD. Diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild interstitial edema. Persistent cardiomegaly.

___ CXR: In comparison with the study of ___, there again is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing pulmonary edema.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.  ___ CXR: IMPRESSION:  Heart size and mediastinum are overall stable in appearance.  Bibasal opacities are minimal, unchanged since ___ with no evidence of progression or consolidations or development of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 

___ V/Q Scan: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary thromboembolism.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o F with PMH of diastolic CHF, hypertension, CKD stage II, severe AS s/p TAVR, DMII, ongoing tobacco use and mod-severe COPD on 2 L of oxygen presents with acute resp failure secondary to COPD exacerbation. Hospital course was complicated by acute diastolic CHF v flash pulmonary edema, now improving and awaiting dispo evaluation. 

#Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure #COPD exacerbation and Acute Diastolic CHF #Chronic tobacco use Mod-Severe COPD with last PFTs in ___ -> FEV1 50% predicted, 2L NC at home and active smoker at baseline. She was initially admitted to the ICU for BiPAP therapy and was slow to improve despite steroids, nebs and azithromycin. Hospital course was complicated by flash pulm edema/CHF exacerbation while in the ICU improved with diuresis (notable BNP increase compared to admission). Overall, patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with primary COPD exacerbation and mild fluid overload. She was diuresed to euvolemia. Notably, she remained deconditioned with oxygen requirement going up to 4L NC with ambulation and very low exercise tolerance. Patient triggered on ___ for hypoxia to 82% on 4L and tachycardia likely due to overexertion though worsening COPD v PE on differential; notably lungs without edema, VBG normal. V/Q scan performed and negative. Patient improved slowly clinically and did not have any other concerning episodes thereafter. She was given round-the-clock duonebs, albuterol nebs prn, Advair (to replace home symbicort which is not on formulary here). She was started on steroid taper, decreased to 50 mg x5 days (___), plan to decrease to 40 mg x5d on ___, then 30 mg x5d, then 20mg x5d, then 15mg x5d, 10 mg x5d, 5 mg x5d then stop. She was continued on GI prophylaxis with pantoprazole. Patient was counseled re: smoking cessation. She was offered nicotine supplementation in-house, which she declined. She expressed understanding regarding the need to quit but declined any further support. 

#Acute on Chronic HFpEF: Mild exacerbation on admission. On ___ am patient developed acute hypertension/tachycardia and respiratory distress that was likely ___ flash pulmonary edema. Pt was treated with diuresis and became clinically euvolemic. Creatinine elevated with ___ on CKD, improved with a break from diuresis. She was restarted on home Lasix 40mg daily but appeared dry as a result thus dose was reduced to 20 mg at discharge. Home lisinopril was held as patient was normotensive, restarted on discharge.

#Acute on chronic CKD: Baseline Creat 1.3, peak 1.6 here likely secondary to diuresis. Patient clinically dry. Was given a break from diuresis and lisinopril was held for part of hospitalization, with normalization of creatinine to baseline. Home meds restarted on discharge per above.

#T2DM: Metformin held given ___. Patient was started on lantus standing, Humalog standing and sliding scale due to persistent hyperglycemia from steroid use. On day of discharge, regimen was lantus 10u qhs, standing Humalog 10u with meals and SSI. Doses decreased on discharge given dose decrease of prednisone starting tomorrow and restarting of metformin.

#Depression/Anxiety: Likely worsened by admission and dyspnea. Continued citalopram and bupropion

#OSA: continued CPAP at night

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] please check weekly chem-7 and monitor Cr and electrolytes [] Lasix dose decreased on discharge to 20 mg. Home dose is 40mg, increase as needed if showing signs of fluid accumulation. [] hyperglycemia in setting of steroid use. She was started on lantus and Humalog since metformin was held in setting of ___. Metformin restarted on discharge and doses of insulin on discharge decreased to reflect decreasing prednisone and resumption of metformin. However, please continue to monitor and adjust insulin as needed. [] prednisone taper: 40mg x5d ___ 30mg x5d ___ 20mg x5d ___ 15mg x5d ___ 10mg x5d ___ 5mg x5d ___ #CODE STATUS: Full code (confirmed) #CONTACT/HCP: ___ (daughter) ___ [x] I spent 45 min in discharge planning and coordination of care
