+ ___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS:   PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  A small right pleural effusion is noted not significantly changed from the prior PET-CT allowing for differences in modality. Otherwise, lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures are intact.   IMPRESSION:   Small right pleural effusion, not significantly changed from prior PET-CT. 

+ ___ Imaging CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON IMPRESSION:   No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. Stable 5 mm nodule in the right lung base. No evidence of pathologic lymphadenopathy.       + ___ Cardiovascular ECHO Conclusions  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of syncope seen. Normal regional and global biventricular systolic function. Near hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Indeterminate indices to assess diastolic function. Calcified mitral and aortic valves with mild aortic regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar.

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is an ___ w/ NHL on CHOP C3D7 on admission, presenting with hypotensive episodes at home s/p a fall. She was hemodynamically stable in the ED and on the floor with normal head and c-spine imaging.

# S/p fall: On admission the patient reported feeling weak and having heart palpitations prior to hear legs giving out underneath her. She denied LOC or chest pain prior to the episode. She states that she has had good PO intake. Her EKG in the ED was notable for a questionable development of a new RBBB, new V3 STD compared to prior, and LAD. A CTA chest was negative for PE. TTE showed no LVOT and normal EF (>55%). She was monitored on continuous telemetry during hospitalization with no abnormal events. She was evaluated by physical therapy, who determined that she was stable for a discharge to home.

# Hypotension: The patient reportedly had had hypotensive episodes at home. She was normotensive on presentation to the ___ ED and remained normotensive during hospital stay. Her orthostatic vital signs on ___ were negative: 110/50, 94 (laying), 104/50, 106 (sitting), 102/52, 108 (standing). Her blood pressures may have been relatively lower than usual due to her C.diff infection with diarrhea, although she denied diarrhea prior to admission and she did not appear hypovolemic on exam. Her vitals were closely monitored during hospital stay. Blood cultures on admission showed no growth to date.

# C. diff: The patient had recently been diagnosed with C. diff colitis and was started on metronidazole prior to admission. This was continued during hospital stay. She did not have any diarrhea during hospitalization.

# NHL: The patient's first cycle of CHOP was on ___ (Rituxan held with first cycle). Her first cycle was complicated by admission for febrile neutropenia with LLL PNA and sinusitis. Her Cytoxan and Adriamycin were reduced by 20% with her ___ cycle of R-CHOP. She had a PET-CT on ___ with resolution of FDG avid LAD. The patient is currently on cycle 3 of RCHOP, She was discharged on day 9. On admission, she exhibited anemia and thrombocytopenia. Workup for hemolysis was negative, including a negative Heinz body prep as well as normal LDH and haptoglobin. Her symptoms of weakness and head-pounding were likely secondary to symptomatic anemia. She was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs and her symptoms improved. Her CBC showed improvement in counts prior to discharge. She was continued on prophylactic acyclovir and dapsone during hospitalization. 

# Gastritis: The patient continued on her home omeprazole.

# Depression: The patient was continued on home citalopram.

# Asthma: The patient was continued on home fluticasone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] The patient will continue her treatment for C.diff with Flagyl 500mg PO TID upon discharge to complete a 14 day course (___). [] The patient should follow up with Dr. ___. [] CTA chest noted a stable 5 mm lung nodule [] Code status: FULL
