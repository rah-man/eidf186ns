 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, RIJ  History of Present Illness: ___ year old female with a history of recurrent UTIs, HTN, Hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease, presenting from ___ with UTI, sepsis and acute renal failure with hyperkalemia.

Notably, the patient was recently discharged from ___ following treatment for an ESBL UTI treated with Ertapenem as an outpatient. Sensitivities showed that the ESBL was sensitive to Zosyn, Penems and Bactrim. Blood cultures from ___ and ___ grew ESBL, with cultures from ___ and ___ growing staph epidermis. These were all drawn from a PICC which was removed on ___ after which point the PICC line was removed and subsequent blood cultures were negative. The patient completed a 7 day course of Vancomycin and a 14 day course of IM Ertapenem (last dose on ___. During that admission, the patient was also noted to have ___ which resolved and was discharged with a creatinine of 0.9. 

The patient presented to the ___ from a nursing home following 2 days of altered mental status. The patient's baseline is generally conversant. Here, she was found to have hyperkalemia to 6.7, with an EKG showing no changes. Her Cr was also noted to be 5.7. She got insulin/Dextrose, Calcium, and 100mg IV Lasix. A foley catheter was placed with 700ccs of thick white urine output. The patient was given a liter of NS and put out an additional 300ccs of urine. She was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. The patient's repeat potassium was unimproved, she was given a second liter of NS, and there was concern for need for urgent dialysis, so the patient was transferred to the ___. Prior to transfer, she had some low MAPs in the ___, and a right IJ was placed.

In the ___ at ___, the patient was noted to be obtunded, but intermittently awake arousable. She was not intubated as she appeared to be protecting her airway. She was pan cultured and started on Zosyn given her previous ESBL UTI which was sensitive. Her potassium was down to 5.4 with a lactate of 2.6, pH of 7.2 and Bicarb of 18. Renal saw the patient and recommended Lasix 160 and then a drip if no good output in 30 minutes, repeating K 4 hours after Lasix, insulin/albuterol for temporizing as well as kayexalate. The patient was given only Zosyn 4.5g IV in the ___, but no further diuresis or temporizing measures for her K. The patient had some low MAPs in the ___ in the ___ and was started on levophed. CXR shoed no pulmonary edema with a CVL at the cavoatrial junction.

  Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final ___:    GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    Reported to and read back by ___ (___) @ 1432 ON    ___. 

IMAGING/RESULTS: CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the SVC/right atrial junction. Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

TEE ___: Conclusions   The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional/and hyperdynamic global systolic function. Elevated PCWP. Aortic sclerosis without stenosis.  

CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  Compared to chest radiographs ___. With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube, slightly more than 2 cm from the carina is ax septal. Care should be taken that it not advanced any further.  Atelectasis at the lung bases is mild. Upper lungs clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. No pleural abnormality. Indwelling right jugular line ends in the low SVC. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. Brain parenchymal atrophy. Moderate hippocampal atrophy, abnormal for age. Enlarged lacrimal glands bilaterally, may be inflammatory in etiology, lymphoproliferative process or neoplasm is less likely. 

RENAL US ___: IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis identified.. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with a history of recurrent UTIs, HTN, Hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease, presenting from ___ with UTI, sepsis and acute renal failure with hyperkalemia. Upon presentation to the ICU, pt developed worsening acidosis and AMS despite BIPAP, and required intubation. Pt was noted to have septic shock requiring pressors, likely from urinary source, and was treated with meropenem. 

ACUTE ISSUES:

#Septic shock: #ESBL E. Coli UTI: #ESBL E. Coli Bacteremia: Likely source is UTI given positive UA and history. Renal u/s showed no hydronephrosis. Prior UTIs have been ESBL sensitive to Zosyn. Received one dose of Zosyn in the ___, as well as one dose of Vancomycin at ___. She was transferred to ___ for critical care. She received IVF and pressors briefly with improvement in BPs. Urine and blood cultures were positive for ESBL E. coli sensitive to meropenem. She was started on IV meropenem on ___ and will need to complete a 14 day course (last day ___. 

___ #Hyperkalemia: ___ with Cr of 5.7 at ___. Suspect this is likely secondary to prerenal azotemia vs. ATN given sepsis and hypotension requiring pressor. Potassium of > 6 at OSH, received insulin and dextrose, down to 5.7 in ___. Patient given fluids with improvement in Cr. K downtrended and normalized, with discharge K of 4.0. Cr continued to trend downward, with discharge Cr of 1.2. 

#Acute Ventilatory respiratory failure #Acidosis: The patient presented with a combined metabolic gap acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Gap acidosis likely secondary to uremia and lactic acidosis in the setting of urosepsis. Unable to keep up with respiratory compensation secondary to encephalopathy with PCO2 of 44 and pH down to 7.15 on BiPAP. Pt was intubated for worsening acidosis and was extubated on ___. She required no further oxygen support. Her acidosis improved with treatment of infection and fluid resuscitation. 

#Encephalopathy: Most likely toxic metabolic in the setting of infection, hospitalization, metabolic derangements, meds, poor sleep, and pain. CT showed no acute intracranial process. EEG revealed no seizure activity. Patient's mental status improved with treatment of bacteremia. Per patient's family, patient was at baseline mentally at time of discharge. 

#Anemia: Anemia below baseline with no concerns for active bleeding. Hb was stable and she required no transfusions. Discharge Hb is 7.5.

#Diabetes type II: Patient had episodes of hypoglycemia on home Lantus dose. It was discontinued and patient was placed on insulin sliding scale. She will be discharged on insulin sliding scale. She should be restarted on home Lantus at a reduced dose if oral intake increases. 

#Troponinemia: Mild troponinemia with EKG not showing dynamic changes. Unlikely acute plaque rupture, and more likely demand. Trops trended to peak. Patient remained without any chest pain. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

#PVD: Continue home ASA and Plavix

#Depression: Continue home fluoxetine

#HTN: Hold home antihypertensives in the setting of septic shock.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] She will need to continue IV meropenem until ___ to complete 14 day course [] Consider restarting Lantus at lower dose as po intake improves [] Consider increasing gabapentin dosage as kidney function improves [] Consider adjusting oxycodone for further pain management
