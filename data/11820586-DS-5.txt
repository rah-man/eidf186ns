Chief Complaint: Klatskin's tumor  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___: Left and Right PTB internal/external drains placed with brushings and forceps biopsy ___: Drains unclogged due to distal occlusion ___: EBUS ___: ERCP, previous stent removal and drain upsize ___: Cholangiogram, 8x60 mm metal wall stents to left and right central biliary ducts, 10x42 mm extending stents placed, Amplatz anchor drains placed. 2 Gold fiducials in bilateral duct strictures (4 markers in all placed) Brushing and Biopsy of left central bile duct stricture ___: Anchor drains removed  History of Present Illness: Mrs. ___ is a ___ female from ___ with a newly diagnosed Klatskin's tumor. She was found to have a mid-proximal CBD stricture with failed stending in ___. She initially presented with abdominal pain and fevers. MRI at that time also showed intrahepatic biliary dilitation with confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. She was admitted to the hospital and started on broad spectrum antibiotics. She underwent attempted PTC drainage and the intrahepatic duct of the right lobe was punctured. Cholangiogram revealed mild dilitation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. A stricture was seen at the proximal CHD and distal right and left ducts and a plastic stent was placed across the CBD. Afterwards her LFTs downtrended and she was discharged home on antibiotics. 

Her son contacted Dr. ___ and she was seen in clinic today after flying over from ___. She is feeling well but anxious about having more procedures done.

Poorly defined intrahepatic mass at the ductal confluence, extending above the bifurcation of the right hepatic duct, and just below the bifurcation of the left hepatic duct. It is not certain if this represents Bismuth 3 or 4 disease (the latter if the left hepatic duct confluence is involved).There is moderate associated biliary diliation.   2. Subcapsular fluid collection along the right lobe of the liver with overlying capsular enhancement, likely related to recent PTC, with associated hematoma or reaction to minor leakage of bile. . CT Chest: Multiple enlarged central lymph nodes, suspicious for lymphatic spread of primary lesion.   2. There are no lung nodules suspicious for metastasis.  Dependent atelectasis mainly in the lower lobes and lingula.  . ___:  Specimen(s) Submitted: COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHINGS, from ___ Common Bile Duct Brushings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Unremarkable and reactive ductal cells. . ___: Right hepatic duct stricture, biopsy: A. Markedly distorted tissue with no evaluable epithelial lining; no carcinoma seen. B. Immunosain for Keratin AE1/AE3/CAM5.2 has been evaluated. C. Multiple levels examined. . ___: Fine Needle Aspirate (EBUS) Negative for carcinoma . ___: ERCP: The left percutaneous transhepatic wire was used to advance the Spyglass catheter into the bile duct to the level of the hilar stricture. The Spyglass catheter could not be advanced into the left hepatic duct to evaluate the extent of disease in this system. The Spyglass catheter was then exchanged over a wire for the pediatric gastroscope, however this also could not be advanced into the left hepatic duct. Therefore the pediatric gastroscope was exchanged for the Spyglass fiber, which was advanced into the left hepatic duct to complete the evaluation. The Spyglass fiber was advanced into the left hepatic duct above the level of the stricture. Contrast was injected to define the left hepatic system. The left intrahepatic ducts appeared normal. The upper edge of the hilar stricture was identified in the left hepatic duct. Under direct Spyglass cholagioscopy and fluoroscopy this appeared to extend 1 cm into the left hepatic duct. The duct walls above this level appeared normal, while the stricture itself appeared malignant. . ___: Left Hepatic duct brushings: ATYPICAL. Sheets of glandular cells with slight crowding and nuclear enlargement. . ___: Liver Biopsy: Pending .

Blood Cultures ___ No Growth

Labs at Discharge: ___ WBC-8.2 RBC-3.71* Hgb-10.2* Hct-33.2* MCV-90 MCH-27.4 MCHC-30.6* RDW-18.0* Plt ___ PTT-45.4* ___ Glucose-125* UreaN-10 Creat-0.9 Na-136 K-3.8 Cl-98 HCO3-26 AnGap-16 ALT-52* AST-57* AlkPhos-520* TotBili-0.6 Calcium-9.0 Phos-2.4* Mg-1.___ y/o female who has travelled from ___ for further evaluation of Klatskin tumor. Initially, she underwent CTA of the abdomen with findings concerning for moderate right intrahepatic biliary dilatation and mild-moderate left lateral segmental biliary dilation. Poorly defined intrahepatic tumor mass was seen at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts, with the common hepatic duct. 

On ___, she had left and right PTB internal/external drains placed with brushings and forceps biopsy done. That biopsy did not show carcinoma, and the brushings were negative for malignant cells. Following the drain placement she was started on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID. The initial specimens from this procedure were also cultured, and did not grow any bacteria.

On ___, she developed fever to 102.3 and was sent to interventional radiology for drain evaluation. Distal occlusion was noted and the drains were un-clogged. Cipro was switched to broad coverage with Zosyn. She continued to have fevers as high as 102.7. Blood and bile cultures were obtained at that time, and Vancomycin was added for gram positive coverage. However, when the culture data finalized as Vancomycin resistant Enterococci, Vancomycin was switched to Daptomycin. Bile culture isolated heavy growth yeast, presumptively not C albicans, heavy growth of an Enterococcus species and rare growth of Pseudomonas. Micafungin was added for the yeast coverage. Fevers subsided over the next ___ hours, and she has remained afebrile since that time.  The ___ service (the pancreatico-biliary service)directed by Dr. ___ endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy to be done with the pulmonary surgeon due to the multiple enlarged central lymph nodes, suspicious for lymphatic spread of primary lesion as seen on admission chest CT. The procedure (EBUS)was done without complication on ___. Pathology was negative for malignancy.  

On ___, an ERCP was done for removal of the previously placed stent which was performed in ___. The drains were up sized, and a Spyglass procedure was performed.

On ___, she underwent a cholangiogram with placement of an 8x60 mm metal wall stent to the left and right central biliary ducts with additional 10x42 mm extending stents placed, Amplatz anchor drains were left in place thru the wall stents. Four fiducials were placed, 2 fiducial markers adjacent to region of left central ductal stricture, one fiducial marker adjacent to region of right central ductal stricture and one fiducial marker in hepatic segment VII. One of the fiducials migrated to the posterior right hepatic lobe during deployment.

Internal/external wall stents (anchor drains) were removed the next day. LFTs were notable for slight increase in alk phos post removal with alk phos increased to 520 from mid ___ to low 400s. She remained afebrile and there was no drainage from the exit sites. Dry dressings were placed. Lidoderm patch was used for pain at drain sites. 

Infectious disease team was consulted early in the hospitalization,and followed throughout this hospitalization making recommendations for modifying the antibiotic course. Recommendations included completion of the antibiotics 48 hours after the external drains were pulled. She received 3 days of Cipro 500 BID, 2 days of Vancomycin 1 gram BID, 17 days of Daptomycin 450 mg BID, 16 days of Micafungin 100 mg daily, 19 days of Zosyn 4.5 mg TID. Surveillance blood cultures were done after the antibiotics were started, and have all been negative.  She has remained afebrile with last fever recorded on ___.

On ___, she felt well enough for discharge from the hospital. The plan is to have f/u with radiation oncology for likely cyberknife treatments. She will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. At time of discharge, vital signs were stable, she alert and oriented, tolerating a regular diet and ambulating with supervision.
