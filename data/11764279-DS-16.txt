Review of Systems: As per HPI   Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History:  ___: Pt presented with vague, dull abdominal pain, imaging showed abdominal mass, with lymphadenopathy and liver lesions. Biopsy of the liver lesion demonstrated well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, metastatic to the liver, originating from the midgut and likely ileum. Pt was asymptomatic and had no episodes of diarrhea, cramping, flushing, tachycardia, hypertension, wheezing or SOB. Pt did endorse fatigue and intentional weight loss of 95lb over the course of ___ years with combined exercise and diet. Her baseline serotonin was in the 1000 range and the chromogranin was also elevated. Due to the elevated tumor markers, she was started on long acting octreotide injection. Her initial dose was 30mg that was increased to 40mg after a recent restaging scan that revealed disease progression. 

On ___ patient presented to clinic and it was decided that the patient should undergo TACE to 'debulk' the amount of active tumor in order to maximize a progression free period and, hopefully, to prolong the amount of time that octreotide is able to control the tumor as a single agent. 

On ___, the patient underwent TACE with complications by E. coli bacteremia and liver abscess. Pt completed 3 weeks of IV antibiotics and was subsequently discharged to a rehab facility. She was in a rehab facility for approximately 3 weeks and then was sent home in the end of ___.
