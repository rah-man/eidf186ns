 History of Present Illness: Primary Oncologist: ___  Primary Care Physician: ___ . HPI:  Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of 3 different stage III melanoma primaries, now with metastatic melanoma, as well as esophageal Ca (treated with chemo/ xrt) diagnosed in ___, and found to have chest wall nodules consistent with melanoma in ___. He presents to clinic with dysphagia and anorexia. He presented with hyperbilirubinemia in ___ and was found to have common bile duct dilation with a distal stomach mass, periportal lymphadenopathy. He underwen duodenal stenting. His repeat PET showed activity in the liver. This stomach mass was thought to be most likely metastatic melanoma and he was started on ipilimumab. He received weeks 1, 4, and 7 of treatment. He was due for week 10 the day before admission but missed treatment secondary to nausea, weight loss (10 lbs), vomiting, abdominal distention. . He states that for the past 2 weeks, he has had difficulty swallowing foods but also some liquids. He states that it is not so much painful as it is difficult to physically swallow.  He has been forcing himself to take ensure 3x/day, but notes that when he forces food, he sometimes vomits after. He notes that he also has increased acid taste in his mouth, belching, hiccuping, and bloating. These symptoms of reflux cause insomnia, resulting in his not having had a resftful nights sleep in 2 weeks. He also notes increased abdominal distention.  He was seen in ___ clinic this afternoon and he was found to have abdominal distention and right sided abdominal fullness. A CT abdomen was performed and showed new ascites. He was referred from clinic for admission for evaluation and treatment of his new symptoms. . Review of Systems:  (+) Per HPI; constipation for the past 6 days; "fainting" 10 days ago in a store after hyperventillating; no presyncope or anxiety since that time. (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies blurry vision, diplopia, loss of vision, photophobia. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.

 Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an ___ yo male with metastatic melanoma, esophageal cancer, distal stomach mass of unknown primary but thought to be metastatic melanoma who presented after 3 cycles of ipilimumab (on week 10 of ipilimumab treatment) with nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, abdominal distention and new ascites.  . #Dysphagia, Nausea, Vomiting - patient has a history of radiation esphagitis and may have developed a subsequent stricture. Also on differential was his abdominal mass causing obstruction. Therefore was GI consulted and pt underwent EGD which showed moderate esophagitis noted in the lower third of the esophagus, patent duodenal stent and biliary stent was seen at the papila. Pt continued to have reflux symptoms spit up coffee ground emesis several times during hospitalization. Pt's PPI was increased and pt received Simethacone PRN. Pt was also put on soft, pureed diet.  . # Metastatic melanoma - s/p 3 cycles of ipilimumab. Although pt found not to have much benefit from chemo treatment thus far. TSH was within normal limits for screening for hypophysitis. Family meeting took place with pt, son, and ex-wife ___onfirmed desire to be DNR/DNI and to be bridged to a ___ facility. Pt expressed desires to be treated for infection while here but not to have any more invasive procedures (eg lower endoscopy). Pallative care consulted and case management made aware of pt's desires. . #Sepsis: Patient with GNR, Klebsiella pneumoniae, transient bacteremia. Likely related to perc nephrostomy tube placement. Patient now afebrile with no leukocytosis and tachycardia resolved. Shortly after nephrostomy tubes placed, pt developed a fever, tachycardia, rigors, and acute leukocytosis. Blood cultures were sent which came back positive for GNRs, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefepime initially started and switched to Ceftriaxone as speciation was known. Pt will require continuation of antibiotics until ___.

#Ascites - pt found to be more distended than usual. There was no evidence of SBP and pt underwent ___ paracentesis. SAAG was .2 and polys were <<200 indicating unlikley portal HTN and unlikely SBP. Cytology for peritoneal fluid was POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. . #Nausea/Vomiting - pt received Zofran, Compazine PRN   . #PPx - venodynes

 Discharge Instructions: Mr. ___,

It was pleasure taking care of you here at ___. You were admitted because of increased difficulty in swallowing, nausea, and vomiting. You had several tests to evaluate if there was a blockage in you esophagus, stomach, or small intestine. These tests indicated that you did not have a blockage and revealed that you have severe esophagitis. While hospitalized it was discovered that your kidneys were not working properly, likely due to a blockage in the bladder and/or ureters. You received two nephrostomy tubes to help relieve the pressure within the kidneys and your kidney function returned to normal. Shortly after having these tubes placed, you developed a fever and it was discovered that bacteria was in your blood therefore you were started on antibiotics which you should continue once discharged. You expressed your desires to the medical team while here that you would like to be transitioned to a rehab facility and then to hospice.  Followup Instructions: ___
