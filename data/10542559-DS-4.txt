 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with PMHx of CAD, DM2, HTN, who presented with NSTEMI on ___ s/p CABG x 4(LIMA-LAD seq to ___ on ___, complicated by sternal wound dehiscence and drainage with vac ___ presenting with confusion and agitation.

She initially presented to ___ on ___ following an episode of intractable chest pain and shortness of breath, found to have an NSTEMI. She was started on a heparin drip and cardiac catheterization showed 3VD for which she was transferred to ___ for CABG evaluation. 

The patient was brought to the OR on ___ where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Admitted ___ and discharged to rehab.

She re-presented ___ with sternal wound dehiscence and drainage. She went to OR on ___ for sternal debridement with vac placement. 

In the OR, the inferior sternal wound was open and there was loosening of the wires. There was some tunneling that probed to bone, so the presumptive diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made, but it was unclear if the infection truly went deep and was just more superficial. 

OR swab was positive for Klebsiella and mixed organisms, which were corynebacterium and CoNS per micro lab. She was treated with meropenem given resistance profile and later switched to ertapenem (confirmed ertapenem sensitive).

Of note, her ___ chest CT, she was incidentally noted to have probable right lower lobe and left upper lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli, and she has been started on warfarin (goal INR ___.

This admission, patient comes as a transfer from rehab with new onset delusions and hallucinations x ___ days. Per report from nurse at rehab patient has had some loose stools, urinary and fecal incontinence, nausea/vomiting, and decreased PO intake. Arrived via ___ due to concern for safety.

Notably, the patient's most recent OPAT visit was on ___. There, patient reported overall doing well until the prior ___ days when she has noticed increased pain in her chest wall and back. She denied any shortness of breath or fever although the notes from the rehab suggested that she was started on levofloxacin for treatment of possible pneumonia as CXR showed "lower lobe infiltrate vs. atelectasis."

Her symptoms included: - Hallucinations which include children running around the room, thinking that her mother died recently even though she died ___ years ago - Paranoia, feeling that people are talking about her, accusatory behavior - Poor safety awareness, rinsing wound with toilet water

Usually ambulates with 1 x assist. No recent falls.

IMAGING: ======== ___ Imaging CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Right PICC line tip is difficult to definitively visualized, however appears to be in the lower SVC.   Worsening retrocardiac opacity may represent worsening atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.   Persistent moderate left pleural effusion, which may be loculated. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 

___HEST W/CONTRAST   IMPRESSION:  Multifocal demineralization of the postoperative sternum, suggesting osteomyelitis. MRI recommended for more precise localization.   Trace left pleural effusion, minimally larger compared to prior study, however still very small, with no evidence of loculations. This is likely secondary to the persistent left lower lobe atelectasis which, in association with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm could be due to left phrenic nerve dysfunction. Consider ultrasound evaluation for better assessment.   No current filling defects in the left upper lobe and right lower lobes. Stable 3 mm nodule in the left apex. Follow-up as recommended below.   RECOMMENDATION(S): MRI of the sternum.   Phrenic ultrasound.   For incidentally detected single solid pulmonary nodule smaller than 6 mm, no CT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk patient, and an optional CT in 12 months is recommended in a high-risk patient.   See the ___ ___ Guidelines for the Management of Pulmonary Nodules Incidentally Detected on CT" for comments and reference: ___ 

___ Imaging MRI CHEST ___ W&W/O CON IMPRESSION: 1. Severely limited study. Within the limitation, there is edema in the distal sternum, deep to the skin incision site. Proximal sternum is not well visualized. Interpretation is difficult due to severe technical limitation, however findings are suspicious for osteomyelitis. 2. Small fluid-filled bony gap is identified in the distal sternum measuring 1.8 cm in length and 0.4 cm in width. 3. Within the limitation, soft tissue edema and enhancement is identified along the deep surface of the sternum in the anterior mediastinum. No fluid collection is identified.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: ====================== # Sternal wound infection # Klebsiella osteomyelitis: S/p debridement ___, followed by OPAT, on ertapenem outpt with projected end date ___. CT chest (___) showed "multifocal demineralization of the postoperative sternum"; MR sternum was done to give more information on whether this represented natural remodeling of bone in the setting of sternal osteo vs worsening or uncontrolled osteomyelitis, but was a limited study given sternal wires. Radiology opinion is that CT and MRI imaging suggest osteomyelitis that appears worse than before. However, per ID and Cardiac Surgery, imaging is consistent with remodeling and not necessarily evidence of worsening infection. Per ID, still early for the abx to see significant changes as well. Wound swabbed with vac change ___ (NGTD). Per Cardiac Surgery, wound was healing well with no visual evidence of infection. She was started on meropenum 500mg IV Q6H while inpatient and switched back to ertapenum upon discharge. S/p vac change ___. Wound vac to be changed q3 days. Next wound vac change to be changed on ___. 

# Delirium: - improving Patient presented with waxing and waning attention, paranoia,hallucinations, which developed 1 wk ago and worsened 3 days ago in context of reduced sleep. Symptoms improved during hospital course. Likely multifactorial iso ?infxn, dehydration, polypharmacy. 1)Polypharmacy (onset of subacute confusion near to when started on levofloxacin 10 days ago, was on multiple potentially delirium exacerbating drugs including oxycodone, amytripyline, metoclopramide, furosemide) 2) infection (known wound infection with osteo radiologically worsening [CT ___, CRP elevated (50) but downtrending and esr wnl at 19, reports of poor wound hygiene) 3) dehydration/metabolic iso of Lasix use and diarrhea (currently wnl). Per ID, they suspect that the primary inciting factor was the Levofloxacin use. This medication was added to her medication adverse reaction list. See bellow for the list of medications held. We continued her home donepezil and started her on Remelteon during her hospital course. 

# Polypharmacy - Held Amitriptyline 25 mg PO QHS:PRN agitation - Held OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg PO Q4H:PRN Pain - Moderate - Held Metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS - Held Pantoprazole 

# Retrocardiac opacity # Left pleural effusion Both present > 1 month. Effusion is likely secondary to the persistent left lower lobe atelectasis which, in association with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm could be due to left phrenic nerve dysfunction. Possibly from the surgery. 

# Anemia: Hct this admission 26.1 down from 37.1 on ___. likely baseline as Hgb similar last admission at ___. No clear signs of bleeding such as GI or from wound. Iron studies show iron deficiency anemia. Hgb improving (9.3 on ___ up from 8.1 on admission). She was started on Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO/NG EVERY OTHER DAY (better effect than daily). Her discharge Hb was: 10.1.

# CAD s/p CABG - Continued Aspirin EC 81 mg PO DAILY - Continued Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM - Continued Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg PO TID - Continued Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg PO DAILY

# Subsegmental PE: On ___ chest CT incidentally noted to have probable right lower lobe and left upper lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli, and she was started on warfarin (goal INR ___. Anticoagulation may not be necessary for subsegmental PE but continue as this is a home med. ***********

# Thrombocytosis Patient presented with platelet count of 283 and during her hospital course, her platelet counted steadily increased in absence of any other additional lab values or new clinical symptoms. Please continue to monitor. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: ======================== # HTN - Held Furosemide 20 mg PO DAILY (suspect dehydration) - Continued Losartan Potassium 100 mg PO DAILY 

# GERD - Held Pantoprazole 20 mg PO Q24H - Continue Sucralfate 1 gm PO QHS 

# T2DM - ISS - Hold home metformin
