              **FINAL REPORT ___

  URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN    AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

IMAGING: CXR PA and Lateral ___ No signs of pneumonia. Right hilar and perihilar scarring similar to the prior CT.  Exercise Stress test ___: INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of stage II lung cancer, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and new renal mass presented to the stress lab from the ___ Emergency Department for the evaluation of chest pain after serial negative cardiac biomarkers. The patient exercised 5.25 minutes of a Gervino protocol (3.3 METs, poor functional capacity for age/gender) and the test was terminated due to fatigue. At 5 minutes of exercise, the patient related the onset of ___ central chest burning radiating to his jaw which persisted into 5 minutes of recovery. Within the context of a right bundle branch block, there were no ischemic ECG changes. The baseline rhythm was sinus and near peak exercise there were several short runs of atrial tachycardia ___ beats) and isolated VPCs. In recovery there were several isolated VPCs. There was resting asymptomatic systemic hypotension (BP 86/60) and there was an appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise. IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms without ischemic ECG changes. Echo report sent separately.

ECHO Stress Test ___: The patient exercised for 5 minutes and 15 seconds according to a Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 155 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 124/56 mmHg. The test was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age and gender. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There is a low resting blood pressure with normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. . Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 106 bpm and a blood pressure of 86/60 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation..

Echo images were acquired within 45 seconds after peak stress at heart rates of 151 - 146 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion.

IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity for age and gender. No ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Resting hypotension.

Compared with the prior study (TTE only - images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ man with stage II (T2aN1M0) squamous cell lung carcinoma s/p chemo/XRT in remission, COPD, paroxysmal afib, and newly diagnosed renal mass pending biopsy presents with persistent exertional chest pain.

# Exertional chest pain: Patient with persistent exertional chest pain. Reassuring that EKG stable from prior, troponin negative x 2, stress TTE in ED with hypotension prior to start of test but with increase during exercise and no ischemic changes. The patient was started on pravastatin 80mg PO qhs. Aspirin continued to be held for potential renal biopsy as per instructions. We continued his home metoprolol XL. The patient was tachycardic (near baseline) but had no hypoxia, so no CTA completed.

# Renal mass: Plan initially to have renal biopsy while inpatient but unable to coordinate. Therefore, patient will get biopsy as an outpatient.

# Diarrhea: Reports one episode of diarrhea in ED, recently completed treatment on ___ for c. diff colitis. C diff positive. Difficult to elucidate if this was recurrence as patient will have positive PCR few months after initial positive result. However, given diarrhea, patient started on MetroNIDAZOLE 500 mg PO/NG Q8H and Vancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO/NG Q6H. The patient was discharged with two weeks of PO vancomycin.

# COPD: We gave Duoneb PRN. Budesonide is nonformulary so we gave advair while in house

# Anxiety We continued home clonazepam 1.5 mg BID PRN

# Depression We continued home sertraline

# Paroxysmal afib: CHADS2VASC 3, not on anticoagulation We continued home metoprolol.

Transitional Issues: =================== [ ] Monitor tachycardia and consider CTA if persistents especially given underlying potential cancer diagnosis [ ] Renal biopsy of renal mass as an outpatient per patient preference. Hold aspirin until after biopsy. [ ] Discuss with patient about anticoagulation given elevated CHADS2VASC after biopsy [ ] If diarrhea/c diff recurs, consider that episode as a ___ recurrence and would need treatment with vanc/flagyl [ ] new medications: --Pravastatin 40mg PO qpm increased to 80 mg PO QPM --vancomycin 125mg PO q6h, please continue for two week course to end ___
