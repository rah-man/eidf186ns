ECG ___ 2:04:44 ___ Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR ___ There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette size is top normal. Aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch. There is mild S-shaped curvature to the thoracic spine with probable compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age. There is no fracture. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.

Echocardiogram ___ The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The aortic valve VTI = 83 cm. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriolry directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of severe AS and atrial fibrillation (on metoprolol and warfarin) admitted with several weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema consistent with exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, discharged home on oral diuretic regimen with plan to follow up outpatient for ___ work up.

# Aortic Stenosis, Severe, Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: Patient has a history severe aortic stenosis but has no symptoms of presyncope/syncope, dyspnea at rest or exertion, or chest pain. Patient is not a surgical candidate for AVR. Patient and daughter spoke to ___ team and would like to pursue further workup as outpatient. Given response to diuresis with ~4 kg drop in body weight and improvement in her lower extremity edema (superimposed on chronic lymphedema), the patient likely has diastolic heart failure. She was discharged on torsemide 5 mg PO daily. Given limited baseline level of function, physical therapy was consulted and recommended discharge to home with home ___ to maximize functional mobility, safety, and independence. Daughter at bedside prior to discharge feels ready to have patient safely discharged home under her and her family's care. Patient has follow up with Dr. ___ ___ for further discussion) and is to follow up with Dr. ___ (primary cardiologist) and her PCP upon discharge.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Majority of hospitalization with good rate control, although ventricular rates up to 130s with minimal ambulation, likely secondary to deconditioning. INR therapeutic on admission. Warfarin continued and patient discharged on metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily.

You were admitted to the hospital because your primary care doctor was concerned about your leg swelling. Given your history of aortic stenosis, you received an ultrasound of your heart to determine the function of your heart. You were seen by the cardiologists and surgeons and after careful discussion, you and the medical team decided that you do not need a replacement valve. You are not feeling symptoms of your valve, which is good. 

Please follow up with your primary care doctor, ___, ___ and your cardiologist, Dr. ___. We made an appointment with Dr. ___ can further assess possibilities of intervention with your valve if you chose to do so.

Please get your labs checked on ___ outpatient to check your INR and electrolyte panel.

Please weight yourself daily on a good quality scale after urinating in the morning in light weight clothing. ___ call MD if weight increases by more than 3lbs in one day or 5lbs in one week

We wish you the best, Your ___ Care team  Followup Instructions: ___
