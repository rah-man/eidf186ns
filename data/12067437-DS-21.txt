CT Head ___: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. CT/CTA ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Focal area of contrast seen at the aortic lumen in the mid descending thoracic aorta, concerning for a leak with focal type B dissection. A delayed scan could be performed through this area to assess whether it is expanding.   2.

 Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to have a low oxygen level and a change in mental status.

You were also found to have a urinary tract infection during your stay which was also treated by the antibiotics that you were on for the penumonia. Your infections are the most likely cause of your low oxygen levels and your change in mental status. You required supplemental oxygen in order to keep your oxygen levels up and you will return to your rehabilitation center on oxygen. We also adjusted your medications to control your blood pressure with a goal systolic blood pressure of 140 or less and treated you for anxiety. You were seen by ophthamology during your stay who recommended that you continue your regimen of eye drops and ointments and also remove the mucous from your eyes and open and close the lids manually as needed to improve your vision.
