Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is an ___ man with PMH of CKD stage IV, HTN, HLD, PVD, s/p open repair of suprarenal and iliac artery aneurysms (___) and memory loss on Aricept, who presents with a witnessed syncopal event with LOC but no headstrike. The patient reports that he has no recall of any events from ___ until this morning, and he awoke to find himself in the hospital. Per the patient's son, he had a witnessed fall yesterday during his brother-in-law's funeral. His father had been standing for a long time in the heat, wearing a jacket and tie and started to fall but they were able to get a chair under him just in time. While in the ambulance, his son saw his father's eyes roll backwards and his body went limp. No reports of bowel/bladder incontinence, tongue-biting, or post-ictal confusion. Per EMS, patient was assisted to the ground, sat-up and had an additional syncopal episode a/w diaphoresis. VS was 160/90, HR ___. Apparently the same event occurred ___ years ago and his father was admitted to ___ for a week with largely unrevealing workup. This event prompted his son to have his father move in with him. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.8 91 157/97 16 98% RA. Labs notable for: WBC 9.4, Hgb 11.5. BUN/Cr 42/3.2 from 47/3.7. TnT 0.11-0.10 with MB 2. INR 1.1 UA negative. ECG SB, LVH, <1mm STD V5, 1st degree AV block new from ___ otherwise unremarkable. Vascular surgery was consulted for concern of interval enlargement of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm which then appeared stable by CT scan. Thus, no plan for surgical intervention, with plan for outpatient follow-up. 

On the floor, patient has no complaints. He is unsure of why he presented to medical care today but states he did not feel well.

IMAGING: ========================== TTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  

CXR ___: IMPRESSION: No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size or mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the descending aorta. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion. 

CT ABD/PELVIS ___: FINDINGS: Detailed evaluation of the solid organs, soft tissues, and vasculature is limited without the use of intravenous contrast. LOWER CHEST: Paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema in the partially imaged lower lungs is moderate to severe, progressed from ___. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. Fibrotic changes in the medial aspect of the left lower lung are unchanged (series 2, image 8). Tiny calcified granulomas indicate prior granulomatous disease. The heart is normal in size. Hypoattenuation of the cardiac blood pool suggests anemia. Coronary artery calcifications are moderate to severe. Aortic valve calcifications are severe. No evidence of a pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion. The visualized portion of the descending thoracic aorta is normal in caliber with diffuse, mild peripheral atherosclerotic calcifications. 

AORTA ULTRASOUND ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Apparent interval enlargement of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, allowing for differences in imaging modalities.  The aneurysm now measures 5.4 cm and previously measured 4.5 cm in ___. 2. Echogenic material within the distal aorta likely reflects the known stent from prior aneurysm repair. No definite evidence of aortic dissection.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure participating in your care while you were at ___. You were admitted to the hospital for syncope. You had tests which revealed that you were very dehydrated and also showed your kidney function had worsened because of the dehydration. We decreased your lasix and gave you IV fluids and you felt better. You also had an EKG that showed your heart rate was slow, so we decreased your metoprolol.  

You are now medically cleared to be discharged from the hospital. Please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department if you have any new or worsening symptoms that concern you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take any new medications as prescribed.

You have follow-up appointments scheduled with your primary care provider and neurologist, the details of which are below.

We wish you the very ___, -- Your ___ Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
