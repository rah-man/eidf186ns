EKG ___: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response rate of 77 beats per minute. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block. Probable prior inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the ventricular response rate is faster. 

Radiology: ___ CT Head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. ___ CXR (PA and Lateral):IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of congestive failure with small left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema. Hyperinflation. ___ CXR (Portable AP): IMPRESSION: Slight interval increase in mild to moderate pulmonary edema, with a small to moderate left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 

  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with chronic systolic CHF, recurrent C. diff infection, AFib who presents with continued diarrhea, dyspnea, and pedal edema. 

 Acute issues:

# C. diff. colitis - The patient was treated with a full course of Flagyl PO without resolution of diarrhea/C. diff colitis and just finished a 3 week course of Vancomycin 250mg PO q6hrs when diarrhea recurred, for which pt was admitted. C. diff was positive again on this admission. GI was consulted who recommended prolonged taper of Vancomycin PO which was started at 500mg PO q6hrs. Pt had ___ BM / day at start of admission which decreased by discharge.

# Acute on chronic congestive heart failure - Pt intermittently complained of shortness of breath during admission. Her home PO lasix was held and she was given IV Lasix for diuresis. Pt was discharged on a higher dose of PO lasix (40mg PO) as current home regimen (20mg) was insufficient to maintain her euvolemic.  She maintained an O2 sat >95% throughout the admission. Her home spironolactone and ASA were continued. Pt was started on Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily.

# UTI - Pt had asymptomatic bacturia which was treated due to concern for a morning of altered mental status. Pt received Bactrim DS 1 tab BID x 3 days. Her course was completed prior to discharge.

# Hyponatremia: Had been hyponatremic on previous admission. Initially thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF. Pt was kept on 1500mL fluid restriction. However, while Na initially started to improve with diuresis it failed to return to normal. Pt was discharged with Na 129. This was thought to be over-diuresis vs. heart failure.

Chronic issues:

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 of 3, but not on Coumadin due to fall risk. Rate controlled. Pt experienced bradycardia on b-blocker during previous admission and so it was not added to her regimen. We continued ASA 325mg PO daily. Pt is not on Coumadin due to fall risk.

# Anemia: Per previous admission, iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Pt was found to be guaiac positive in ED at this admission. Hct was trended (stable) and pt was stable.

# Dementia: Stable througout admission. Oriented to person, "hospital", not oriented to year. Able to recite days of week forward and backward with significant prompting and hesitation. Continued home Donepezil and mirtazapine. 

Transitional issues:

# Electrolytes: Lasix dose increased and ACEI added this admission. Should get electrolytes checked ___ and continued every other day. 

# Risk for readmission: Pt with significant dementia requiring 24hr care.
