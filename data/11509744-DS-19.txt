 Pertinent Results: CT of the head: ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Small right frontal subdural hematoma, not exerting significant mass effect.  2. Subtle hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe may be a small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage vs less likely artifact. Attention on follow up is recommended.

CT Thoracic spine: ___ IMPRESSION: Mild superior endplate compression of a mild thoracic vertebral body of unclear acuity and new since ___. 

CT of Head: ___ IMPRESSION 1. No interval change in size of small right frontal subdural hematoma with no significant mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures. 2. Subtle hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe sulci, likely subarachnoid hemorrhage, is unchanged. No new areas of hemorrhage are identified. 

CT of Thoracic spine: ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Mild anterior wedging of the T5 vertebral body is likely due to degenerative changes.
