 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a very nice ___ gentleman with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent mitral valve repair via a minimally invasive approach in ___ in ___. His course was complicated by transient atrial fibrillation, but otherwise he made a good recovery. Postoperatively he still had a significant murmur of mitral regurgitation and he underwent an echocardiogram that demonstrated moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. The ejection fraction was preserved and the LV ___ were not increased. For about 6 months he has noticed increasing DOE and fatigue but no chest pain. 

He has developed worsening DOE after a ___ut no difficulty with climbing 2 flights, no PND, no edema.  Pt was seen on ___ and surgery was recommended but pt wished to postpone his surgery until ___.  An echocardiogram on ___ demonstrated a mildly dilated left ventricle and normal ejection fraction of 55-60%. There was mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. A mitral annuloplasty ring was in place with prolapse of the posterior leaflet. There was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 

He met with Dr. ___ in clinic on ___ and agreed to proceed with mitral valve repair (via first sternotomy). He presents today for cardiac catheterization and completion of preop testing prior to surgery tomorrow  Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Mitral Regurgitation Aortic Aneurysm Dupuytren's Contracture Glaucoma Osteoarthritis Past Surgical History: ___ Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Repair, ___ in ___ - Dr. ___ Palmar fasciectomy with extension to fourth and fifth joint; left. ___ Moh's surgery for basal cell on face  Social History: ___ Family History: Father - lived in to age ___.

Pre-op TEE ___ Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral annular ring appears well seated with normal gradient. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with posterior polapse of p2 and 3 and an eccentric jet originating at A3 P3.. 

 Post Bypass: Patient is AV and later A paced on norepinenpherine and epinehperine infusions. There is a mitral valve annuloplasty ring and leaflet motion consistent with a commisuroplasty. Peak mitral gradient 6 mean 3 mm Hg at cardiac output of 5 LPM. There is trace residual mitral regurgitation at the a3 p3 site. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

PA and Lateral CXR ___:

Comparison to ___. The venous introduction catheter on the right has been removed. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal view. The chest radiograph shows no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Stable correct alignment of the sternal wires. 

  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where the patient underwent Median sternotomy and redo mitral valve repair with an A3/P3 commissuroplasty. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient developed atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility and deemed appropriate for discharge home. By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged to home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
