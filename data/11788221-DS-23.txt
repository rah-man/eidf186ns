 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zosyn / ceftriaxone  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Unresponsiveness, altered, intubated for airway protection found to have urosepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubated, mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: ___ yo female with MS on tegretol for questionable hx TMJ who was sent in from her ___ after being found covered in vomit with agonal breathing. ___ notes reports "symptoms of seizure activity" with patient subsequently unresponsive and found to be hypoxic with sats <83% on 2L. Per EMS, she was unresponsive en route, still breathing but not withdrawing to pain.  . In the ED, initial vitals were: no temp recorded, 118 135/71 34 100% on NRB. She was easily intubated for airway protection with a grade 1 view. Head CT was unremarkable for bleed. Neuro was consulted and felt this was likely toxic metabolic if seizure activity, but will continue to follow. She has had multiple episodes of UTI in the past. Blood and urine cultures were sent and she was given vanco/zosyn. Foley was changed.  Per the ED resident, they were not aware of her potential allergy but she did not have a rash prior to transfer to the MICU. When the patient was signed out she was currently doing well on vent with most recent vitals prior to transfer being afeb, 92, 103/60 with sats 100% on 400x18, 5x50%. She dropped her pressures prior to transfer to 67/41 with HR 94. She was given 2L of IVF and started on levophed. Sedation was held.  . Of note, per Dr. ___ note to her PCP, her last admission was for urinary tract infection, E. coli bacteremia, and sepsis, and initially required admission to the ICU for vasopressor support. She was also found to have an obstructing left renal stone and had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed with improvement in her infection. She was able to be taken of vasopressor agents and was discharged to complete a 14 day total course of antibiotics. At that time, urology recommended to leave the nephrostomy tube in the left renal system indefinitely with tube changes every 3 months as she was high risk for both nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Her hospital course was also notable for hypoxia with a 4L oxygen requirement which was felt to be due to a combination of mild volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of multiple sclerosis and infection, and intermittent aspiration. Her oxygen requirement was stable and she was discharged to rehab to have gentle diuresis as tolerated and tocontinue her usual dysphagia diet. She has been on 2L at her ___ with unclear continued workup.  .   Past Medical History: Multiple Sclerosis - about ___, followed by ___ at ___  - wheelchair at baseline, lives in nursing home - has no use of her lower extremities, sometimes spastic movements - bladder chronically contracted UTI with ESBL E.coli--sensitive to zosyn, ___, gent in past Chronic Depression Anxiety PVD s/p lower extremity bypass COPD Osteoporosis Hx of +PPD bilateral femur supracondylar fractures ___ hx of Urosepsis - hospitalized about once/yr, per husband ___ bladder - indwelling foley x ___ yrs, per husband ___ C. ___ Hx of Sacral ___ ___ spasticity Hx of jaw pain -- ?TMJ, improved on Tegretol

TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and apical anterior and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 40%). The apex is not aneurysm and no apical thrombus is seen. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Pulmonary artery hypertension. 

CTAbd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1. Foley catheter is now positioned with its distal tip seen in the right ureter. Repositioning is recommended. These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ by telephone at ___:10 a.m. on ___.   2. Left nephrostomy tube with small left subcapsular hematoma and unchanged left ureteropelvic junction stone.   3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction despite large amount of stool seen within the rectum and sigmoid.   4. Unchanged right renal staghorn calculus. 

Renal US: IMPRESSION:   1. Right renal stones without hydronephrosis.   2. Unchanged mild left collecting system fullness. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with history of MS with chronic indwelling foley and left percutaneous nephrostomy tube found to be unresponsive admitted to the MICU with septic shock secondary to Pseudomonas urosepsis. The patient was started on Meropenem and did well on the floor. . 1. Sepsis: Urosepsis due to pseudomonas in setting of obstructing stone. Pt with known obstructing staghorn in R, & L percutaneous nephrostomy for ureteral stone. The patient had been on suppressive ertapenem, but this was switched to Meropenem 500mg IV Q6hr given ID recs and better urinary penetration. ID evaluated the patient and felt she should continue on this antibiotic until obstruction relieved. The patient was started on methemazine and ascorbic acid for symptomatic relief. Pt will follow up with outpatient urology to undergo intraoperative lithotripsy/stone extraction. . 2. Elevated troponin/Possible NSTEMI: Pt's troponin found to be elevated on admission. This was likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension. An echo was formed that showed wall motion abnormalities, the chronicity of which could not be determined. The patient's troponin trended down and she was monitored on telemetry for several days with no events. . 3. Multiple sclerosis: The patient had relapsing and remitting MS treated with Glatimer. Our neuro colleagues were initially consulted to determine whether her altered mental status was neurological in origin. They determined that it was not and did not change her treatment regimen. She remains on Baclofen, Glatimer, and cyclobenzaprine. . 4. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin  .  5. Depression: Continue citalopram  .  6. CODP: Respiratory status stable. Continue nebulizers/inhalers . 7. Follow Up: The patient will follow up with urology for elective stone removal. She will continue on meropenem until urinary obstruction is remedied. . Transitional Issues: The patient had yeast grow in 2 of 2 urine cultures. With her h/o urosepsis and indwelling catheters, we called her rehab facility and recommended starting Fluconazole. As an outpatient, the patient should be started on a low dose B-blocker given her NSTEMI. She should have outpatient cardiology follow-up at some point as well.
