Chief Complaint: fevers, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left and right heart catheterization, coronary angiogram ___ multiple dental extractions ___ placement of intra aortic balloon ___ mitral valve replacement, MAZE,ligation of left atrial appendage ___

 History of Present Illness: This ___ year old white male has had essentially no medical for 20 plus years. he was told in the early ___ he had dental abscesses but declined intervention then. He recalls fever at the time, despite a 10 day course of antibiotics. He eventually underwent dental surgery and received another 10 day course of antibiotics. He now presented to ___ with fever and malaise and a murmur was appreciated. An echocardiogram was concerning for mitral vegetation and after being cultured was begun on Vancomycin and Unasyn. He was then transferred for further evaluation.

Echcardiography and cardiac catheterization were performed and a flail posterior mitral leaflet was seen. Denatal extarctions were performed after an intra aortic balloon was placed for stabilization. Infectious Disease was consulted as well. .   Past Medical History: dental abscess  Social History: ___ Family History: No h/o premature coronary disease or stroke. Father and mother both had heart disease, unsure what type. Sister passed away from heart disease at ___.   Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM GENERAL: Pleasant, frail-appearing elderly man in NAD. Oriented x3. HEENT: NCAT. MM dry. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Poor dentition.  NECK: Jugular veins distended, JVP above earlobe.  CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular, normal S1, S2. Harsh IV/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at ___ border. +RV heave, +palpable thrill.   LUNGS: Pectus excavatum. No accessory muscle use. Bibasilar crackles, R>L. Diffuse rhonchi.  ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. +BS. No abdominial bruits.  EXTREMITIES: Cool. No c/c/e.  SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.  PULSES:  Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ ___ 1+  Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ ___ 1+ . DISCHARGE EXAM

 Pertinent Results: TTE (___): Dilated atria. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global and regional systolic function. Probable flail posterior mitral leaflet with at least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation in the presence of a possible septal leaflet vegetation. At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (IVC not visualized).

TEE ___ posterior mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. No vegetation, mass, or thrombus seen.

RUQ ultrasound (___): 1. Extremely dilated hepatic veins and IVC, and pulsatile PV flow, findings suggestive of right heart failure, tricuspid insufficieny and congestive hepatopathy secondary to cardiac dysfunction. 2. No definite hepatic mass or abscess. 3. Large right pleural effusion. 4. Limited examination of the pancreas, biliary tree, and gallbladder. 

Cardiac Cath (___): 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparant coronary artery disease. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated significantly elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with a mean RA pressure of 22 mmHg, a RVEDP of 22 mmHg, a mean PA prssure of 39 mmHg, and a mean PCWP of 22 mmHg. 3. The Cardiac output/index were severely reduced to 1.9/1.0 4. SVR and PVR were elevated 5. An IABP was inserted in the right femoral artery 6. A 8 ___ venous sheath was sutured in place. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Following admission the Infectious Disease service was consulted. Several TEEs failed to reveal mitral vegetations, but did demonstaret a flail posterior leaflet. Antibiotics were continued. No coronary disease was found at catheterization and an intra aortic balloon was placed to stabilize hemodynamics and unload the ventricle. Beta blockade was utilized to reduce his rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation.

Multiple dental extaractions were completed as he was prepared for cardiac surgery. On ___ he went to the Operating Room where valve replacement, MAZE and ligation of the left atrial appendage was performed.  The tricuspid regurgitation was reduced to trace after mitral replacement. The balloon was retained and the right heart was severely impaired at the end of surgery, requiring Milrinone, Epinephrine and Neo Synephrine to wean from bypass. Tissue culteres and ribosomal PCR samples were sent intraoperatively.  Vasopressin was added on the night of surgery. His IABP was removed on POD2 followed by worsening heart function- his pressor support was escalated and the intraortic balloon pump was reinserted. He stabalized momentarily but then developed a lactic acidosis and elevated liver function tests. He was seen by general surgery and brought to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy and cholecysectomy. Post-operatively he had acute renal failure requiring Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis. He also developed bilataterally cold lower extremity limbs and the IABP was removed. Eventually, his toes became necrotic. He ultimately was found to have developed heparin antibodies and all heparin containing meds/catheters were stopped and he was started on Argatroban. He continued to have an escalating pressor need and was hypothermic. Blood cultures ultimately grew out ___ albicans- he was started on antifungals at that time. A long discussion was carried out with family. Given the fact that his prognosis was poor, and that his quality of life would be what the patient desired, even if he was to recover from the sepsis, the family decided to make this patient comfort measures only. His pressors were stopped and he expired shortly thereafter. He was pronounced at 15:40.
