 History of Present Illness: Patient is an ___ woman w hx of NPH s/p VP shunt, CVA w residual R-hemiparesis and wheelchair-bound, ESRD on HD TTSa, who has been having fevers and leukocytosis x5d at her rehab, sent to OSH for somnolence during HD on ___, and transferred to ___ given c/f VP shunt malfunction (ruled out), now being admitted to medicine for further ___ and likely infection. 

Reportedly has been running low-grade temperature since ___ and ___, was started on 7d doxy course by rehab MD ___ what source, if any, was being targeted). Per daughter's report, patient either fell or slid (daughter concerned rehab employees have given her different versions of events) out of her wheelchair. Patient does not recall this. Towards the end of HD session on ___, noted to be severely agitated (stating she no longer wants HD and would rather die), and the session was terminated early. In the ambulance on the way back to rehab, she was noted to have an episode of apneic/agonal breathing and sent to ___ instead for further evaluation. 

At ___, noted with temp 100.1 and altered mental status, treated for presumed sepsis with IVF, vanco/aztreonam. CXR reportedly clear. Her head CT shows hydrocephalus. CT torso was unremarkable. Chest x-ray with no pneumonia. Given concern for possible VP shunt malfunction/infection, transferred to ___ for ___ evaluation.

Since arriving at ___ ___, had LP (wnl) as well as shunt study per ___ recs, which was also normal. Initially, her mental status improved and daughter reported patient close to her baseline, awake and alert oriented Ã—4.

PERTINENT IMAGING: ================ ___ Shunt Series: VP shunt appears intact. Mild pulmonary edema. No acute abdominopelvic process.

___ RUE ultrasound: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

___ TTE The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferobasal wall and hypokinesis of the mid inferior wall, basal to mid inferolateral wall, and basal to mid inferoseptum (see schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. Left ventricular cardiac index is high (>4.0 L/min/ m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater than 18mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. There is an eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is no tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction most consistent with single vessel coronary artery disease (PDA distribution). Moderate, eccentric posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation.

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a hx of NPH s/p VP shunt, CVA w residual R-hemiparesis, and ESRD on HD ___ who presented from OSH for VP shunt evaluation in the setting of encephalopathy. She was cleared by neurosurgery, and then admitted to medication for leukocytosis and fevers. Her course was notable for cellulitis of the right upper extremity overlying site of (nonfunctioning) AVF and staph epidermidis bacteremia. She underwent removal of her right tunneled HD line on ___ and placement of new left tunneled HD line on ___.

ACUTE ISSUES: ============= # Leukocytosis, fevers # Cellulitis of RUE fistula # Staph epi bacteremia Skin exam was concerning for cellulitis given RUE erythema and swelling surrounding the right fistula, which improved after initiation of vancomycin. On ___ she was found to have staph epi bacteremia, with blood cultures continuing to return positive through ___. Infectious disease was consulted. Concern for line infection so vanc locks were started for HD line. Given persistent bacteremia HD line was removed and patient had line holiday for 72 hours with negative cultures before line was replaced (pulled ___, replaced ___. TTE was negative for vegetations and upon discussion with ID, this organism is low risk for endocarditis and the risk of pursuing TEE outweighed the benefits. She will be discharged to complete a 2 week course of vancomycin, dosed at HD, with day 1 being the day of line removal. Abx course ___.

# NPH s/p VP shunt # Toxic metabolic encephalopathy Presented with several days of fevers and altered mental status, found to have leukocytosis concerning for infection. CT head at OSH showed hydrocephalus and CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. She was transferred to ___ for shunt evaluation, which was felt to be functioning after a shunt series and neurosurgery evaluation. Etiology of her altered mental status was felt to be due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection described above.

# Type II NSTEMI # Bradycardia Troponin 0.54 on admission and quickly downtrended to 0.45. The patient also had an episode of reported bradycardia to the ___ monitor reported ___, while EKG recorded HR of ___, so unclear if true bradycardia. Likely bigeminy PVCs as EKG was consistent with rate in the 60-70s. Her home carvedilol was held. Troponin was rechecked and remained in the 0.3-0.5 range. EKG remained unchanged and the patient was never symptomatic. TTE showed "Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction most consistent with single vessel coronary artery disease (PDA distribution)." Recommend further evaluation as an outpatient and medical optimization: she is already on an aspirin and statin; holding carvedilol as above.

# RUE swelling/pain Presented with RUE swelling and pain concerning for infection vs DVT. RUE ultrasound was negative for clot. Infection treated as above.

# Sacral tissue erosion, reported a history of sacral wound. Evaluated by wound care and not consistent with pressure injury but scattered areas of tissue erosion, secondary to fecal incontinence.

#Goals of care #Depression #Bipolar disorder She was continued on her home escitalopram. Mirtazapine was held initially due to encephalopathy but resumed prior to discharge. She intermittently was refusing care (bowel medications, fistulogram, SC heparin, etc). On admission, the patient's daughter expressed concerns that HD was making her mother miserable and noted that her mother had been frequent in hospitals /rehabs over the last several months. Several goals of care discussions occurred and palliative care was consulted. Patient shared that her goal is ultimately to get home. She shared that for now she wants to continue all treatments, including procedures and IVs, if this means she can one day get home. She was still had a very depressed mood and despite these conversations often refused care. Code status discussion was felt not be productive or reliable in the setting of severe depression/passive suicidal ideation while inpatient. Continued home mirtazepine and escitalopram.

# QTc prolonged 500/515 on admission EKG. Rechecks ___ and ___ were normal(470) but ___ with QTc 538. QTC prior to discharge on ___ was 499. Avoid additional QT prolonging medications.  CHRONIC ISSUES: ================ # ESRD on HD The patient continued on HD on ___ (held during line holiday) and her home medications without issues. 

# Prior CVA, residual deficits uncertain # Wheelchair-dependent at ___ rehab Pt deconditioned and wheelchair bound at baseline. She worked with physical therapy while inpatient. 

# T2DM Home Januvia was held on admission and the patient's BG was controlled with sliding scale insulin. 

# HTN Presented on amlodipine, carvedilol and hydralazine as outpatient. All blood pressure medications were initially held given concern for infection and then an episode of bradycardia. Amlodipine and hydralazine resumed prior to discharge. Carvedilol held as above.

# Anemia Hgb at around her baseline on admission. Likely due to chronic kidney disease. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =========================== [] Code status should be addressed with patient once she is out of the hospital and not acutely ill. Code status discussion was felt not be productive or reliable in the setting of depression/passive suicidal ideation while inpatient. Please involve pt's daughter in these discussions. [] Abx course to complete ___. Vancomycin should be dosed with dialysis. [] Inpatient transplant team recommending fistulogram for further evaluation of right upper extremity fistula. [] Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction most consistent with single vessel coronary artery disease (PDA distribution) seen on TTE. Consider additional evaluation as outpatient with stress test or LHC if within patient's goals of care. [] Carvedilol held at discharge. Discuss restarting low dose 3.125 mg BID if heart rates and blood pressure will allow. [] Limit QTc prolonging medications. [] Patient with LEFT tunneled HD line, provide care as appropriate
