MICROBIOLOGY ============ LYME SEROLOGY (Final ___: NO ANTIBODY TO B. BURG___ DETECTED BY EIA. Reference Range: No antibody detected. Negative results do not rule out B. burg___ infection.  Patients in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may not produce detectable levels of antibody. Patients with clinical history and/or symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in ___ weeks. 

RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final ___:    NONREACTIVE.    Reference Range: Non-Reactive.

REPORTS ======= ___ EKG Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Prominent T waves seen in the early precordial leads raise concern for acute ischemia/hyperkalemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.  TRACING #1 

___ CT Head IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pneumonia. 2. Hyperdense foreign body projecting over the left upper quadrant. Correlate for prior history of trauma. 

___ EKG Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Borderline prolongation of the Q-T interval. Non-specific ST segment changes are seen inferiorly. Compared to tracing #1 premature atrial contractions with compensated repolarizations are seen. The Q-T interval is significantly more prolonged and T wave morphology is also changed. Clinical correlation is suggested may be due to drug or metabolic effect. 

TRACING #2 

___ CT A/P There is a metallic radiodensity measuring 13 mm posteriorly in the left upper quadrant. This is just deep to the posterior left twelfth rib, likely at or just below the diaphragm. The appearance is compatible with a bullet. This is located about 1 cm lateral to the left kidney and is immediately inferior to the spleen. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification with mild aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries. IMPRESSION: 1. Position of bullet as detailed above. 2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification with mild aneurysmal dilation of the common iliac arteries.

ACUTE ISSUES ============

# HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY She has chronic hypertension and is noncomplicant with her lisinopril. OMR notes previous prescriptions of HCTZ and Toprol XL, but patient states she has never taken these before. Her HTN may have contributed to her AMS, though mental status and blood pressure have fluctuated independently throughout her course. Most likely cause of HTN is medication noncompliance. ECG with no major change from prior ___ ECG which showed LAD and LVH, probably from longstanding hypertension. Per JNC 8 guidelines, long term goal BP for this elderly patient without DM or CKD is <150/90. She was not started on HCTZ, given the risk of electrolyte abnormalities in noncompliant patient. Given precipitous decline in BP and episode of bradycardia on the night of admission, beta blockers were also avoided. She was started on lisinopril 20mg and amlodipine 2.5mg. These were uptitrated to lisinopril 40mg and amlodipine 5mg to achieve goal SBP 140-160. She will be continued on these doses of lisinopril and amlodipine at discharge.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS) Patient's ___, reported that she was concerned her aunt's memory and balance in ___. She felt that patient's mental status was worse compared to baseline during an ___ phone call but returned to baseline on ___. The patient's confusion likely has some component of underlying baseline cognitive disorder superimposed with acute, now resolved delirium, likely related to uncontrolled blood pressure, recent fall, or circumstances of hospitalization. TSH, B12, Folate, RPR normal. She had a normal sleep and awake EEG to rule out atypical seizure activity. Her head CT was normal. She was evaluated by neurology who suspected an underlying frontotemporal dementia. She cannot get an MRI due to history of a gunshot with retained bullet (shown on CT A/P with bullet near kidney and spleen). The patient lacks decision-making capacity. She has no insight into her cognitive deficits. She is not able to recall the circumstances of her admission, absorb medical information or weigh the risks and benefits of her decisions. Guardianship was initiated as the patient does not have any family or friends willing to be an HCP. Her acute alteration in mental status has resolved and she is cleared from a medical standpoint. Her personality and cognition are back to baseline, but at this time requires geriatric psychiatry placement. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== # Please continue lisinopril 40mg daily and amlodipine 5mg daily for goal SBP 140-160. # Please schedule the patient for a PCP appointment when she no longer requires extended care (___).  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY 2. Amlodipine 5 mg PO DAILY 3. Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg PO Q4H:PRN agitation 4. QUEtiapine Fumarate 12.5 mg PO QHS 5. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain,fever 6. Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID 

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS ================= 1. Hypertensive emergency

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES =================== 1. Dementia

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ with very high blood pressures and confusion. We kept your blood pressure under control and monitored your mental status. You continued to be too confused to safely return home. Our social workers met with you and we worked out a plan to establish guardianship as well as for transfer to a geriatric psychiatry unit until you are able to safely return home.

We wish you the best!
