Bilobed aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery which projects anterior superiorly and to the right and measures 7 mm in maximal dimension. 

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY ___: Normal left ventricular regional/global systolic function. Right ventricular dilatation with preserved systolic function. No signifcant valvular disease. 

CAROTID/CEREBRAL BILAT ___ Successful primary coiling of a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm without any proximal or distal thromboembolic complications. The patient remained neurologically intact afterwards. No other aneurysm was found in anterior or posterior circulation.

___ Chest X ray Heart size normal. Lungs clear. No cardiomediastinal hilar or pleural abnormality. 

___ Bilateral lower extremity Ultrasound No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremity veins.

___ CXR As compared to ___ radiograph, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new. No definite new areas of consolidation are identified to suggest a site of infection. 

___ Head CTA w/&w/o contrast Decreased subarachnoid hemorrhage with interval coiling of anterior communicating artery aneurysm and persistent cerebral edema. Right parafalcine area of hypodensity may represent evolving infarct. Multifocal ares of decreased caliber of intracranial vessels with irregular contour compatible with vasospasm. Appearance of hypervascularity within the left cerebral hemisphere likely represent collateral flow in relation to decreased arterial flow from vasospasm. 

___ Chest X ray As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes have increased. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION:   1. No new intracranial hemorrhage is visualized. 2. There is decreased cerebral swelling with better visualization of the basal cisterns and ventricles. 3. The previously seen hypodensity in the right parafalcine region is less apparent. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was admitted to the neurosurgical service in the ICU for close monitoring. She was taken Neuro ___ on ___ for a coiling of her aneurysm under ___ anesthesia.

She was mentating clearly and was full strength in her upper extremitys and antigravity in her lowers. Isolated muscle group testing was difficult given both effort and our language barrier and patients lethargy. 

On ___, patient reported nausea and vomited x1. She was neurologically intact on examination. TCDs were performed and showed no vasospasm in the L PCA, MCA, bilateral verts. She remained on 100cc/hr IVF and Q1H neuro checks.
