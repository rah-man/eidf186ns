Noncontrast head CT (___): No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CT-A chest (___):  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Moderate emphysema. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis with secretion/aspiration seen within left mainstem and right maintstem bronchus and bronchi to the right lower lobe. 4. Moderate cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion. 5. Ascending thoracic aortic dilation. Enlarged main pulmonary artery which may indicate pulmonary hypertension. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ with h/o systolic CHF (LVEF 35-40% in ___, COPD, CAD, AF on ASA, bradycardia s/p ___ placement transferred on ___ from ___, where he was intubated for respiratory distress, after p/w SOB x4 days, now breathing well post-extubation.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure: He presented from an OSH intubated and sedated and received aggressive diuresis for CHF (noted below), as well as steroids for COPD exacerbation (noted below). He was extubated successfully on ___ without fever, HD instability, leukocytosis, or other e/o infection throughout admission.

#Acute-on-chronic CHF: Patient with known sytolic CHF (LVEF 35-40% in ___ p/w clinical e/o fluid overload and CXR with prominent pulmonary vasculature in the absence of clear inciting event. He was diuresed with IV Lasix, with good effect, followed by 80mg PO daily, up from his home dose of 40mg PO daily, with resulting mild hypervolemia and return to his home supplemental oxygen requirement of 2L, prompting transfer from the MICU to the medical floor. On attainment of euvolemia on the floor, his home dose of Lasix 40mg PO daily was continued. Home atenolol and lisinopril were continued. TTE demonstrated mild-moderate AR, mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function (LVEF >55%), mild PA HTN, and dilated ascending aorta.

#COPD: Patient with known COPD was noted to be hypercarbic while ventilated.

#BPH: Home tamsulosin was continued on this admission. 

#Transitional issues: -Acute-on-chronic CHF: Home atenolol was continued on the current admission, but switch to metoprolol or carvedilol may be considered on PCP ___ for maximal therapeutic benefit. -AF on ASA: ASA was continued for prophylactic management, given h/o falls and supratherapeutic INR, but anticoagulation with warfarin or Pradaxa may be considered on PCP ___ if felt to be appropriate. -Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count was stable without active signs of bleeding, and further evaluation was deferred to PCP ___. 

 Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  Information was obtained from PCP. 1. Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY 2. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS 3. Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY 4. Furosemide 40 mg PO DAILY 5. Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY 2. Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY 3. Furosemide 40 mg PO DAILY 4. Lisinopril 5 mg PO DAILY 5. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure participating in your care while you were admitted to ___. As you know, you were admitted for shortness of breath and arrived from another hospital with a tube down your throat on a ventilator for help with your breathing. After the tube was removed, you were able to breathe well on your own with supplemental oxygen, which you use at home. Your shortness of breath was likely due to fluid in your lungs, and you received increased doses of your home diuretic (Lasix) to remove the fluid. It will be important to continue to take Lasix at home to ensure that fluid does not reaccumulate in your lungs. Given the possibility that your chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was contributing to your shortness of breath, you also received steroids to help with your breathing.
