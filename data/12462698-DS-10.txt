Small right pleural effusion.  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ speaking lady with a history of B-cell lymphoma, WAIHA (on prednisone), chronic hepatitis B (on Entecavir) and HFpEF, recently hospitalized at ___ from ___ for fall, who presented after pressing life line button at home for unknown reasons with evidence of hemolytic anemia on labs that appeared to be at recent baseline.  # Confusion, weakness: There was initially concern for confusion based on EMS as well as ED reports, which was most likely due to a combination of mild dementia and the language barrier. Family confirmed that pt has some short term memory problems intermittently at baseline and that they did not appreciate any acute change. On arrival to the floor pt was oriented to person, hospital and month/year. Pt was unable to state why exactly she pressed the emergency alert button, aside from overall feeling poorly and needing extra assistance. She had no signs or symptoms of infection on initial work-up. Head CT was negative. She had been taking Ativan at home nightly, this was stopped on admission due to high risk for adverse effects in the elderly. Given current presentation and recent OSH admission for ___ there was concern from the team about whether Ms. ___ was safe to return home with current level of supervision. She lives alone with HHAs that assist for several hours each day along with visits from family members but does not have 24 hour care. Physical therapy recommended rehab however patient and son would only agree to go to ___, which pt was not eligible for due to her current hospital level of care. After extensive discussion of options with medical team and case management the patient and her son refused rehab and patient was discharged home with services. 

# Hemolytic anemia (WAIHA): Pt has known history of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia with underlying B-cell lymphoma and chronic hepatitis B, followed by Heme/Onc at ___ (Dr. ___. Per OSH records, she had a recent H/H of 8.2/24.6 on ___ and last received 1UPRBC on ___. She was being treated with prednisone 12.5mg daily prior to arrival. On admission labs there was clear evidence of hemolysis (Tbili 3.1, LDH 513, Hapto<5, Retic 12.6%) with H/H of 8.2/24.2, which was stable compared to recent values from OSH. Iron studies revealed normal Fe, transferrin with elevated ferritin. CBC was trended initially and remained stable. She was continued on her home prednisone dose and Bactrim for PCP ___. She will need to follow up with her Dr. ___ discharge. 

# Orthostatic hypotension: While working with physical therapy on the morning of ___ her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70's without increase in HR. She remained asymptomatic throughout and her BP improved to the 90's on recheck in a seated position. The drop in blood pressure was thought to most likely reflect a medication effect given the timing after her morning medications and a recent increase in her torsemide dose per records. Her torsemide dose was decreased from 20mg to 10mg daily. Blood pressures remained in low-normal range prior to discharge.  # Chronic HBV: Continued entecavir for suppression in the setting of WAIHA treatment.  # Chronic dHF: Baseline EF and weight unknown. Per records had recently increased torsemide dose to 20mg daily. Appeared euvolemic to dry on exam. Torsemide dose was decreased to 10mg daily as above. Her home metoprolol and ASA were continued.  # HTN: Blood pressures remained well-controlled in low normal range as above. Home metoprolol was continued.   # Osteoporosis: Continued home calcium/vit D. # Chronic pain: Continued home ultram as needed.
