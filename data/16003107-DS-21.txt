Heart size is normal.

On ___, the patient underwent an open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details). The patient was given an epidural for pain control, which controlled her pain well. However, in the PACU, the patient required a transient phenylephrine drip, 2 L fluid bolus, and one dose of albumin due to a systolic blood pressure in the ___, while mentating well and being entirely asymptomatic. Of note, the patient had taken her HTN medications that morning. With adjustment of the epidural parameters, the patient was easily weaned off the phenylephrine, with stable blood pressures in the 90-100s. Thereafter, she was trasnferred to the general surgical floor with a foley catheter, NPO, on IVF, with a foley catheter and JP drain. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

General Brief Hospital Course:

Neuro: The patient orgiginally received an epidural on POD1, however, it did not control her pain, the epidural was split and then discontinued on POD2 at which point the patient was transistioned to oral pain medication with IV breakthrough.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was successfully transitioned to oral pain medications, and had good pain control thereafter. 

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint after transfer from the PACU to the floor; vital signs were routinely monitored. Of note an a-line was placed briefly while the patient was in the ICU to monitor hemodynamics. a-line was discontinued on POD4 as patients hemodynamics remained stable throughout the rest of her hospital stay.

Pulmonary: On POD2 patient has an episode of desaturation to the mid 70's which was transient and imporved with IS usage and O2 per nasal cannula. Patient experienced another episode of desaturation to the 70's which also responded to supplemental oxygen however, this episode was associated with a change in mental status. Pateint was hemodynamicaly stable, O2 saturation remained above 90 with supplemental oxygen and UOP was sufficient. WBC was however elevated at 18 and the decision was made to transfer the patient to the ICU for a further w/u of altered mental status. Blood gases were followed closely and the patient was continued on supplemental oxygen. ABGs remained consistent with a picture of chronic COPD. While in the ICU patient remaine stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, however, she continued to have episoded of altered mental status especially in the evening. Workup (please refer to Pertinent Results section) proved negative for pulmonary embolism. Imaging and clinical correlation was suggestive of pneumonia, and the patient was treated accordingly (please refer to ID section below).

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Once appropriate bowel function was seen to return, the patient was transitioned to clear liquids, then full liquids, and finally a regular diet. She tolerated all these steps well.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection throughout her stay. As discussed above, the identification of pneumonia prompted requesting the input of Infectious Disease specialists. Per their recommendations, the patient was started on IV vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. The vancomycin was discontinued after 2 days, while cefepime and flagyl were continued through till discharge. Please note that per recommendations, the patient was discharged with prescriptions, and clear instructions to take THREE (3) DAYS of antibiotics after discharge as follows: Cefpodoxime 400 mg PO q12H, and Flagyl 500 mg PO q8H. 

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Based upon the operative pathology, the Liver experts and Hematology/Oncology team were consulted. They visited the patient, and recommended further follow-up as outpatient to make further plans. The patient and her family expressed strongly their interest in completing her recovery at rehab, and pursuing further once she felt more physically improved.
