EKG captured a regular, wide complex tachycardia. This was felt to be VT. The trigger was likely adrenergic surges from de compensating LV systolic function vs a bundle branch reentry. She was treated with amiodarone. Her subacute presentation with DOE was felt to be from worsening LV systolic function from persistent Afib that was preventing BiV pacing. She underwent AV nodal ablation (as well as R bundle ablation to prevent RBB-reentrant VT). She was discharged with symptomatic improvement. 

# VT: Regular wide complex tachyardia of two morophologies, one of which was LBBB morphology. Not inducible in cath lab. She got about 3.5 g of amio loaded over four days and was continued on amiodarone 200 mg daily to continue until she sees her EP cardiologist next. She had no further ventricular tachycardia in the hospital. Her digoxin dose was halved while on amiodarone. She underwent Right bundle branch ablation (+AVNodal ablation) in case the VT resulted from RB reentry. Precipitants of the VT were likely to be either inferior scar, worsening CHF, or possibly bundle branch reentry. Trops .___-.___-.02.

#acute on chronic systolic CHF/ peristent Atrial fibrillation: She appears to never have recovered to functional baseline since surger, with significant DOE with any activity. On exam she did not appear volume overloaded, had no pulmonary edema and remained on room air.  TTE with impaired LV systolic function (20%) with the same inferolateral akinesis present in ___. TR is now severe. Potential etiologies of her worsening heart failure include ongoing ischemia (less likely given recent cath without progression of disease) or a pressure overloaded LV ___ her repaired mitral valve. Another possibility felt to be likely was ongoing Afib, which was conducting down her endogenous conduction system and causing her to receive BiVentricular pacing only about 60% of the time, leading to ventricular dyssnchrony given her baseline LBBB. Her metoprolol was uptitrated and she underwent AV nodal ablation. After the ablation she was BiV paced 100% of the time at a fixed ventricular rate of 80. She remained in Afib. Had significant symptomatic improvement. Diuresis was initially attempted but resulted in ___ as discussed below. On day of discharge, home diuretic restarted. ACE inhibitor was not initiated given ___. For her Afib, her home coumadin was continued.

___ on CKD: Cr between 2.1-2.5 which is at baseline. Steadily rose with IV diuresis this admission, confirming clinical suspicion that she was not grossly volume overloaded., indicating that she is not improving with preload reduction.  Her elevated JVP is likely a reflection of her now severe TR given her decompensated LV function and worsening pulmonary hypertension. Her diuresis was held until the Cr improved back to baseline. it was 2.4 on day of discharge and her home torsemide 60 mg BID was restarted.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ventricular tachycardia Atrial fibrillation

Secondary: acute on chronic systolic heart failure tricupsid regurgitation diabetes chronic kidney disease

 Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented, clear and coherent, ambulating independently

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to the ___ after feeling dizzy and being shocked by your ICD. You had a heart arrythmia, likely a dangerous rhythm called ventricular tachycardia. You were started on a new medication, amiodarone, which you should continue to take daily until otherwise instructed by your cardiologist. We have also increased your home metoprolol and converted it to a long acting version: metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily. We have also decreased your digoxin dose.

Your more chronic symptoms of shortness of breath with activity were thought to be caused by your ongoing atrial fibrillation which was interfering with your pacemaker. You underwent an ablation of your heart conduction system to ensure that you are paced 100% of the time and to reduce your chances of having recurrent ventricular tachycardia.

Please contnue to weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

It has been a pleasure taking care of you at the ___.
