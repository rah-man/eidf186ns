 History of Present Illness: ___ yo F with history of COPD/asthma (2L NC at home), breast cancer (s/p mastectomy), pAF/tachybrady syndrome with recent PPM placement c/b RV perforation with pericardial effusion, Afib with RVR, recent HCAP tx with Levofloxacin who presents with progressive SOB, sputum production, chills and recurrent atrial fibrillation with RVR.  In brief, patient was in usual state of health when she developed an episode of chest discomfort and unresponsiveness x 10 seconds with shaking of her extremities at home and was admitted to ___ ___. Had DDD ___ pacemaker implanted ___ for SSS w/HR ___ and 3.3 sec pauses. Subsequently developed ___ chest pain and Chest CT showed RV pacemaker lead extends 2 cm below the RV wall, tip lying in the pericardial fat pad just behind the left anterior lateral sixth  rib. TTE showed pericardial effusion without tamponade. She was transferred to ___ for further monitoring. She underwent lead extraction in the OR on ___ and was persistently hypotensive afterwards requiring intubation and pressors. In this setting she developed a transaminitis that was thought to be secondary to hypotension. Her pericardial effusion remained minimal and she was restarted on apixaban prior to discharge. Her course was otherwise complicated by recurrent afib with RVR, which was initially treated with DCCV and sotalol but she was subsequently transitioned to metoprolol for rate control. Finally she was noted to have a positive UA and productive cough and so was treated for HCAP UTI with levofloxacin. She was discharged on ___ to rehab.  At rehab she reports that she has been feeling unwell. She feels that her breathing has worsened and she is more SOB than her normal baseline. She reports that she has had worsening chills but no fevers and has had worsening cough with sputum production. Finally she notes that she has had worsening lower extremity swelling and was started on Lasix at rehab without significant improvement.  She states that in this setting she developed increased fatigue and SOB on morning of admission. This prompted an EKG, which showed a fib w/ RVR. This prompted her transport to ___.  She was taken to ___ where intial vitals were 99.4 89 131/65 18 94RA. She was ill appearing per their documentations. Labs were notable for Tnt <0.01, WBC 16.8 (89% N), Hgb 12.2. proBNP 2463. CXR showed left lower lobe consolidation with associated effusion. Given recent admission to ___ she was transferred for further care. No medications were given.

Labs/studies notable for: WBC 16.5, Hgb 11.7. proBNP: 2629, Trop negative. UA bland. Bilateral LENIs negative for DVT, LUENI with no clot but phlebitis.  Patient was given: IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam 4.5 g  Vitals on transfer: 99.1 86 20 140/70 95% 2LNC  On arrival to the floor, patient reports that she feels fatigued from the days activities but does not have any specific complaints other than chills and LUE arms swelling.
