 Discharge Instructions: Division of Otolaryngology  Head and Neck Surgery Post-Operative Instructions Endoscopic Sinus Surgery

An Endoscopic Sinus Surgery is an operation to open up the sinuses and remove disease from them with the help of telescopes.

    Do not blow your nose. If you sneeze, do so with your mouth open.

    Expect some bloody discharge or blood-tinged secretions. Bright red blood is not expected, and should not be seen.

    Do not use aspirin or any non-steroidal medicines (like Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen), as these may increase bleeding.

    Pain will be assessed, and medication prescribed, before you leave the hospital.
