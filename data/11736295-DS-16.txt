Chief Complaint: Right arm fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right humerus ORIF

 History of Present Illness: ___ PMH of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (previously on docetaxel, now s/p cycle 4 radium), DVT (on Eliquis), T2DM, CAD, presented to ED with right arm pain found to have pathologic fracture of right humerus, admitted for pain control and further management

Patient reported that he has been at rehab for the past 2 weeks working on mobility with a walker, due to chronic deficits in right lower leg. He noted that he did not make much progress overall. On day of admission, he tried to support himself with his arms to get up using his walker, heard a loud pop, and had immediate pain in his right upper arm. Called ___ and was brought to the ED. 

In the ED, initial vitals: 98.1 92 104/50 18 100% RA. UA negative for infection. 

Right Shoulder Xray: 1. Acute fracture extending obliquely through the right proximal humerus with minimal displacement. 2. Thickening of the right humeral cortex and heterogeneity of the medullary cavity is concerning for underlying infiltrative process, especially given patient history. MRI could be considered for further evaluation of underlying bone marrow to confirm that this is a pathologic fracture. 3. In addition, areas of relative increased sclerosis in regions of the right lateral ribs and inferior tip of the right scapula concerning for metastatic disease.

Right Humerus Xray: Again seen is a mottled appearance of the right humerus with an oblique fracture through the proximal to mid right humeral diaphysis. No significant displacement. Distally, no additional fractures identified. 

Ortho was consulted, rec'd sling for time being while awaiting final recs. Patient was given NS and oxycontin/oxycodone prior to admission.

___ 6:49 am BLOOD CULTURE

  Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  No growth to date. 

Imaging: ___ CXR: Elevated right hemidiaphragm may be secondary to right lower lobe atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 

___ Arm Xray:  10 intraoperative images were acquired without a radiologist present. Images show steps during an intramedullary nail fixation of the right humerus. For details of the Procedure, please refer to the operative note.  Total fluoroscopic time most 205.3 seconds. 

Xray arm ___: Again seen is a mottled appearance of the right humerus with an oblique fracture through the proximal to mid right humeral diaphysis.  No significant displacement. Distally, no additional fractures identified. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ PMH of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (previously on docetaxel, now s/p cycle 4 radium), DVT (on Eliquis), T2DM, CAD, presented to ED with right arm pain found to have pathologic fracture of right humerus, now s/p ORIF ___, discharged to rehab with plan for close oncology/orthopedics f/u

#Post Operative Fever Occurred post operatively, infectious workup identified atelectasis but no e/o infection. Abx withheld and fever self-resolved.

# R Proximal Humerus Fracture Atraumatic, pathologic, and minimally displaced. Reassuringly had no new neurovascular deficits. Has baseline dysfunction in right arm ___ prior chemo extravasation event. Ortho-onc performed ORIF ___ that was uneventful. Rad onc evaluated patient, are considering radiation for symptom control but can not be done within 2 weeks of ORIF, so pt will need to followup with them as an outpatient for re-evaluation. Ortho appointment scheduled before discharge, patient will need to f/u to have repeat Xray's and staples removed. Length of stay expected to be less than 30 days. 

# Castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer Previously on docetaxel, now s/p C4 Radium-223. Unfortunately he has no other options for his prostate ca. He might be eligible for two more doses of Radium-223 but this will need to be done once he has convalesced and returned home. The benefits at this stage are limited and palliative. Per Dr ___ expectancy much less than 6 month, but as per my discussions with patient and his son/HCP ___, patient is to remain FULL CODE. 

# Chronic Neoplasm Related Pain Per last outpatient pall care note, patient was supposed to be on oxycontin ___ but he noted that he was only taking 20 BID at home.Was increased to 30 QBID to account for increased pain from humeral fracture, and was written for lidocaine patches + gabapentin + capsacin + duloxetine to good effect.

#Recent dx of DVT RLE presentation (edema/assymetric enlargement) unchanged per patient. Resumed apixaban POD1 and had no e/o bleeding

#T2DM: Previously on metformin. AC1 5.5% this admit. has not needed insulin while here, can hold off on ___ at rehab

#Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: Chronic, likely from neoplastic disease, required intermittent blood transfusion during stay. Next CBC will need to be checked on ___ with transfusion as needed. 

Transitional issues: 1. Ortho appointment scheduled before discharge, patient will need to f/u to have repeat Xray's and staples removed. 2. Patient will need to be referred to rad onc in outpatient setting if pain persists after 2 weeks 3. Patient will need to schedule outpatient f/u with Dr ___ in ___ weeks 4. Next CBC will need to be checked on ___ with transfusion as needed.
