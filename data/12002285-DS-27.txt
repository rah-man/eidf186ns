 History of Present Illness: The patient is an ___ year old ___ woman with a history of afib on Coumadin (INR 3.0), CAD, CHF EF 40%, prior L MCA stroke ___, HTN, CKD baseline Cr 2.0-2.5, presenting with shortness of breath and facial droop which is now resolved.

The patient was in her usual state of health yesterday. Last night for dinner she had steak, rice, and peas, and ice cream. This morning when she woke up she was feeling short of breath and generally unwell. Her daughter came and noted a L facial droop, which she had never noted on prior occasions. The patient herself thought she felt that her face was "pulling to the R side." This has improved since this morning per the daughter, and is milder at the time of evaluation in the ED, but her face still looks asymmetric. The ED resident felt at the time of initial evaluation there was a prominent facial droop ("2 on NIHSS") which was resolving when Neurology saw the patient.

She has had several episodes of dizziness which she describes as "wobbly", denies vertigo. She gets these periodically, often after she gets up in the morning, and they are transient. She had an episode of dizziness yesterday while getting into a van to come home from her day program, and another episode this morning getting out of bed. This is not very atypical for her.

She endorses baseline R sided weakness after her stroke in ___, this is not worse than usual.

NCHCT - No acute infarct or hemorrhage, unchanged left frontal lobe encephalomalacia.

Carotid U/S - (prelim read) no evident stenosis

Brain MRI/MRA No evidence of acute infarct mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus. Moderate brain atrophy and changes of small vessel disease seen. Chronic left parietal infarct is identified. No evidence of acute or chronic blood products. 

MRA of the neck demonstrates flow in both carotid no vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion. MRA of the head demonstrates diminished flow in the basilar artery. This is similar to the MRA of ___. This may be secondary to slow flow or chronic occlusion of the basilar artery. Flow signal is identified in both posterior cerebral arteries. The anterior circulation is unremarkable.  Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ came in with a brief spell of right facial weakness in the setting of probable UTI and mild CHF. NCHCT and MRI were negative for acute ischemia, and MRA/Carotid US showed no carotid disease. Her exam here was normal on arrival and continued to show no neurological deficit. ___ felt she was safe to discharge with home ___ with ___ for INR checks while on warfarin and ASA. Our suspicion is that she had brief recrudescence of old stroke symptoms in the setting of metabolic problems. She was therapeutic on warfarin/ASA (INR 3.0 on arrival, 2.1 at discharge) and we plan to continue this. She will have Stroke Clinic follow up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - INR management. In-house the patient got 4mg warfarin daily, due to uncertainty of dose 4mg vs 5mg daily. Her INR remained therapeutic but slowly drifting downward and needs close follow up ___ (INR ___, INR ___, INR ___. We plan to discharge her on the home coumadin 5mg daily, and she may not need to drop the dose on ___.

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: facial droop recrudescence of prior stroke urinary tract infection

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, 

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of shortness of breath and right sided weakness that resolved by the time you arrived to the hospital. You were briefly admitted to the Neurology Stroke team for MRI of the brain to look for stroke. Fortunately we found no evidence of stroke. On labwork we found that you likely have mild worsening of your long-standing heart failure as well as a mild urine tract infection which we treated with antibiotics. Sometimes when you have medical problems, symptoms from an old stroke can worsen briefly. We think this was the case with your facial weakness. We found no evidence to suggest that your symptoms were caused by a stroke or TIA and we were reassured by your normal exam in the hospital. 

We decided to continue your home doses of aspirin and warfarin for future stroke prevention. You completed a 3-day course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection and need no further treatment at this time.

Please take your other medications as prescribed and follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. 

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:  - sudden partial or complete loss of vision  - sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  - sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you  - sudden weakness of one side of the body  - sudden drooping of one side of the face  - sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.  Followup Instructions: ___
