 Brief Hospital Course: ___ man with history notable for HTN, HLD, COPD, prediabetes, CEA x2, and dementia transferred from ___ after presenting with acute-onset right facial weakness and aphasia, found to have small left frontal IPH. Etiology of hemorrhage unclear, though suspect cerebral amyloid angiopathy (particularly with history of dementia and lobar hemorrhage), with less likely alternatives on the differential including hemorrhagic transformation of a prior ischemic infarct or underlying vascular malformation. Repeat ___ on the second day of admission demonstrated stable hemorrhage. Initial course complicated by hyperactive delirium requiring intermittent doses of olanzapine and haloperidol, subsequently resolved and well-managed with nightly quetiapine. Subsequent course notable for dysphagia managed with a modified diet (see below), on which Mr. ___ was able to maintain adequate caloric intake. ___ evaluation recommended discharge back to Mr. ___ long-term care facility with increased assistance with functional mobility and use of rolling walker.

Course notable for hyponatremia on admission likely ascribable to oxcarbazepine, which was switched to divalproex without concern for further seizures (incidental note was made of a brief period of biceps tremor that resolved with resting the arm, not concerning for seizure). Course also notable for pyuria and fevers ascribed to a likely urinary tract infection treated with a six-day course of ceftriaxone transitioned to an additional day of cefpodoxime (AM and ___ on ___ on discharge. Urinary retention was briefly noted prior to discharge, with voiding trial initiated on day of discharge. Consideration may be given to outpatient Urology follow-up if there is ongoing concern for urinary retention.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. Ongoing speech and swallow therapy for aphasia and dysphagia. 2. Ongoing blood pressure monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensives. 3. Voiding trial ___, with outpatient Urology follow-up if concern for ongoing retention.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were transferred to ___ from ___ after developing right face weakness and difficulty speaking. A CT scan of your brain showed that your symptoms were due to a small bleed on the left side of your brain, which remained stable on a follow-up scan. The cause of your bleed is not clear, so you should have an MRI done after leaving the hospital to look for an underlying blood vessel problem, old stroke, or signs of small prior brain bleeds that may suggest an issue with the blood vessels in your brain. You also had some difficulty swallowing safely as a result of your brain bleed, for which you were placed on a modified diet; this will continue to be reassessed after you leave the hospital.

During your stay, your sodium levels were noted to be low, which may have been a side effect of your seizure medication (oxcarbazepine). This medication was replaced with valproic acid during your stay, without concern for further seizures.

During your stay, you were also found to fevers and signs of a urinary tract infection, for which you received a course of antibiotics that you will continue after leaving the hospital.

Please follow up with your primary care provider within the next ___ weeks. Please also follow up with Neurology at the appointment listed below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

Sincerely, ___ Neurology  Followup Instructions: ___
