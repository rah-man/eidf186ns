Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization change. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no change. . ___ CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there is increasing size of the cardiac silhouette given the PA rather than AP view. Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion. Silhouetting of one of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with lower lung consolidation. . ___ RENAL U/S Transplant renal kidney in the right lower quadrant measures 9.9 cm, and has unremarkable gray-scale appearance. There is no hydronephrosis or mass. There is no perinephric fluid collection. Color Doppler evaluation of the transplant renal vasculature shows normal flow and waveforms, with resistive indices ranging from 0.7 to 0.75 in the segmental arterial branches. Diastolic flow in the main renal artery is very slightly diminished, but main renal artery waveform is otherwise normal, with brisk systolic upstroke. Main renal vein has normal flow and waveforms. IMPRESSION: Unremarkable transplant renal ultrasound. . ___ CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pulmonary edema has markedly increased in severity. There is now clear evidence of moderate-to-massive intra-alveolar and interstitial fluid accumulation. The size of the cardiac silhouette and the absence of pleural effusions is unchanged. There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. . ___ TTE There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate hypokinesis of the septum and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Borderline dilatation of the left ventricle with regional LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, wall motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images were suboptimal). Diastolic dysfunction can now be clearly determined. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly. . ___ CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the signs suggestive of pulmonary edema have moderately decreased. They are, however, still present. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of right pleural effusion, the left sinus is not shown on today's image. . ___ CXR AP PORTABLE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. The aorta is mildly tortuous with calcifications noted of the arch. The patient is status post sternotomy. Pulmonary edema has significantly improved and there is now mild residual interstitial edema. There is mild subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base on this image which does not fully include the costophrenic sulcus. There is no pneumothorax or evidence of pneumonia. IMPRESSION: Significant improvement in pulmonary edema with now mild residual interstitial edema. Mild subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base. . ___ LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S FINDINGS: Gray-scale and color Doppler images of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and peroneal veins were performed. There is absence of color flow and non-compressibility of the left peroneal vein, otherwise, there is normal color flow, compressibility and augmentation. Left Bakers' cyst is seen. IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with thrombus in the left peroneal vein. . ___ TTE The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and likely the inferior septum (image quality suboptimal). Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is indeterminate. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with focal regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the estimated pulmonary artery pressures are now indeterminate. . ___ LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler sonograms of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins were performed. There is normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of the vessels including the two left peroneal vessels. No DVT is identified today. Again seen is a ___ cyst in the left popliteal fossa.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg with resolution of the thrombosis recently seen in the left peroneal pain. Left ___ cyst. . ___ RENAL TRANSPLANT U/S FINDINGS: The renal transplant is identified in the right lower quadrant and measures 10.1 cm in length. There is no hydronephrosis and no perinephric collections are identified. DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. Abnormal arterial waveforms are identified in the main renal artery and in the intraparenchymal renal arteries. There is no diastolic flow identified on any of the tracings. This appearance is consistent with rejection. Appropriate venous flow is identified in the main renal vein.  IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal arterial waveforms in the transplant kidney with no diastolic flow identified. This appearance is consistent with rejection. Normal venous flow identified in the hilum of the transplant kidney. 2. No hydronephrosis and no perinephric collections identified.

 Brief Hospital Course: #DVT/PE - Lower extremity doppler U/S on ___ revealed thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The patient was started on heparin gtt. Due to concomitant hypoxemia, a presumptive diagnosis of PE was made. V/Q scan was deferred due to underlying COPD and a baseline abnormal CXR, and CTA chest was deferred due to renal insufficiency. Repeat U/S ___ showed resolution of DVT. Coumadin was started ___ after hematocrit had remained stable (goal INR ___. He will likely require ___ months of therapeutic anticoagulation. Goal INR is at the lower end of the therapeutic range due to his GI AVM's, prior bleeding and risk for re-bleeding. . #Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure - Attributed to a combination of discontinuation of diuretic medication, alterations in the antihypertensive regimen, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. Treated with hemodialysis and medical diuresis. TTE ___ revealed LVEF 35-40%, moderate septal hypokinesis, and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments. He demonstrated adequate room air oxygenation prior to discharge. He will be discharged on aspirin, metoprolol, furosemide, metolazone, and isosorbide mononitrate for afterload reduction. An ACEi was not prescribed due to allergy. He was advised to record daily weights and to adhere to a low sodium diet with 2 L fluid restriction. . #Acute on chronic renal insufficiency - Due to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of CHF exacerbation and antihypertensive therapy, as evidenced by an extremely low urinary sodium on admission. Initial renal ultrasound was unremarkable, but repeat exam on ___ revealed evidence of rejection. Serum tacrolimus level was therapeutic. He was advised to adhere to a low sodium/potassium/phosphorus diet. Per the Transplant Nephrology team, the initial plan will be twice weekly HD when he is discharged to the rehabilitation facility. He has a f/u app't at his primary nephrologist's office in 4 weeks (Dr. ___. At that time, he will be seeing the NP, who will make arrangements for an app't with Dr. ___ ___ after (this was due to scheduling availability).  . #Acute blood loss anemia - The patient had guaiac positive stools without overt evidence of bleeding. The patient was transfused a total 5 U PRBC. He was treated with IV iron and erythropoetin. Colonoscopy ___ revealed a proximal ascending colon AVM which was treated with argon thermal therapy. Endoscopy on that date showed non-bleeding erosions in the stomach and proximal jejunum. He will continue on twice daily PPI. Outpatient capsule endoscopy was recommended. Has been on IV iron therapy and will need 3 more days (started ___ for an 8 day course). Please remove his R PICC line after IV iron therapy is completed. . #Toxic encephalopathy - Attributed to effects of medications, as mental status improved after the discontinuation of prednisone and oral narcotics. Delirium did not seem to improve following hemodialysis, making uremic encephalopathy unlikely. Infectious workup was unremarkable. ABG was not suggestive of profound hypercarbia or hypoxia. EKG did not reveal evidence of new ischemia or arrhythmia. Electrolytes, glucose, and LFT's were within normal limits. Mental status returned to baseline prior to discharge, as corroborated by the patient's wife. . #Status post cadaveric renal transplant - Sirolimus was changed to tacrolimus at the recommendation of the transplant nephrology team. Serum tacrolimus level was therapeutic. Continued MMF and bactrim prophylaxis. The patient will be seen in close follow up in transplant clinic following discharge. . #Post-herpetic neuralgia - Continued fentanyl patch and nortriptyline. At the recommendation of the chronic pain service, lyrica was added with subsequent resolution of symptoms. . #Mood disorder - The patient was seen in consultation by psychiatry who recommended the addition of mirtazapine with a subsequent improvement in mood and sleep. It was recommended that the patient consider formal neuropsychological testing in the future to evaluate for memory or cognitive deficits. . #Coronary artery disease - No acute issues. Aspirin, betablocker, and statin were continued, as above. . #Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - No acute issues. Continued advair and nebulized bronchodilators as needed. . #Hypertension - Blood pressure was well-controlled on a regimen of metoprolol and isosorbide mononitrate. . #Dyslipidemia - Continued simvastatin.
