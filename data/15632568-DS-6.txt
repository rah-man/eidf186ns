  Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final ___:    GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CHAINS.    Reported to and read back by ___ (___) @ 841 ON ___. 

Urine cx ___ negative 

IMAGING: CXR Portable ___ Portable AP views of the chest were provided. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. Emphysematous changes are re-demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of airway wall thickening with atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Old right clavicular and multiple right rib fractures are noted.  IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and bronchitis with small bilateral pleural effusions.

CTA Chest ___ 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormality. 2. New moderate T3 vertebral body compression deformity without retropulsion. 3. Moderate emphysema. Bibasilar and left upper lobe mucous impaction with chronic airway wall thickening without focal consolidation. 4. Small loculated left and trace right pleural effusions decreased from ___. 5. Unchanged large ascites. 6. Hepatic steatosis.

CT Abdomen Pelvic ___ 1. Diffusely dilated small bowel, with wall thickening, concerning for ischemia in the setting hypotension, given extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the superior mesenteric artery. 2. Wall edema throughout the colon, which may be related to third spacing or a nonspecific, infectious or inflammatory colitis. 3. Re-demonstration of a mass at the pancreatic head, with upstream dilatation of the pancreatic duct, compatible the patient's known pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 4. Omental stranding/caking, compatible with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Small volume ascites is unchanged. 5. Pneumobilia, compatible with CBD stent patency. 6. Distended, sludge filled gallbladder.

TTE ___ The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF = 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis and a positive ___ sign. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, right ventricular function is now depressed but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive compartison. 

Knee films ___ There is mild medial compartment narrowing without significant osteophyte formation. No fracture or dislocation seen. There is a small joint effusion. There is extensive vascular calcification. No radiopaque foreign body seen.  IMPRESSION:  Mild degenerative changes, no acute bony injury seen.

RUQ US ___ IMPRESSION:

1. Tumefactive sludge in the gallbladder. 2. Echogenic liver and moderate ascites. 3. Right pleural effusion.

CXR Portable ___ Lower inspiratory volumes with patchy opacities at both lung bases, compatible with collapse and/or consolidation, new compared with ___, and small bilateral effusions, which are also larger in the interim.  Mildly dilated patulous loop of small bowel in the left upper quadrant. Clinical correlation is requested.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with PMHx of ETOH cirrhosis (ascites), recently diagnosed pancreatic CA s/p stent on ___, presumed extensive CAD, presenting to the ED from ERCP suite in ___ for  hypotension with concern for septic shock requiring pressors. Lactate initially 6.6 but improved with fluid resuscitation. Infectious w/u was notable for neg urine cx, blood cx growing GPC in chains that ultimately speciated to enterococcus. Was empirically treated w/ vanc/ceftazidime/flagyl due to concern for intraabdominal source in addition to empiric cdiff coverage. CTA was neg for PE. CT A/P showed Diffusely dilated small bowel, with wall thickening, concerning for ischemia in the setting hypotension. Surgery was consulted and given he would be a poor surgical candidate recommended NPO status, empiric antibiotics. Also s Wall edema throughout the colon, which may be related to third spacing or a nonspecific, infectious or inflammatory colitis as well as Omental stranding/caking, compatible with peritoneal carcinomatosis. There was some concern for abnormal gall bladder wall appearance. RUQ US showed Tumefactive sludge in the GB that was unchanged from prior. Course was c/p troponinemia. Troponin elevated to 0.7 on presentation, with <1mm STE in inferior leads on initial arrival. Cardiology consulted and believe that likely demand ischemia given improvement in STE once volume resuscitated. Initially managed with heparin gtt, but was stopped on ___ given downtrending troponin. TTE showed depressed RV function with ___ sign from unclear sign. After discussion with family, was made DNR, DNI. 

On the night of ___ developed acute onset dyspnea and altered mental status. Extremities were noted to be cool and dusky. Lactate was found to be rising precipitously from 1.5 earlier in the day to a peak of 12. Became progressively more hypotensive requiring multiple pressors. EKG showed likely new STD in the precordial leads. Heparin gtt was started empirically in addition to linezolid empirically for VRE however continued to decompensate. Given the rapid decline and concern for ischemic bowel on earlier CT A/P, concern was that this was likely related to ongoing or worsening ischemic bowel, perhaps related to a new embolized clot given the acute decompensation. Blood gases showed worsening acidosis despite resuscitation and pressor support. Family was notified and came to the hospital. He ultimately passed away peacefully with his family at the bedside on the morning of ___.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO DAILY 2. Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY 3. Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H 4. Vitamin D 800 UNIT PO DAILY 5. Potassium Chloride 20 mEq PO DAILY
