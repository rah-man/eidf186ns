 Discharge Instructions: INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal to feel tired or "washed out" after surgery, and this feeling should improve over the first few days to week.  - Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING: - Touch down weight bearing

MEDICATIONS: - Please take all medications as prescribed by your physicians at discharge. - Continue all home medications unless specifically instructed to stop by your surgeon. - Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers. - Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and take a stool softener (colace) to prevent this side effect. - Please continue to take your antibiotics to prevent infection until your follow up appointment.

ANTICOAGULATION: - Please take aspirin daily for 4 weeks to prevent blood clots

 

WOUND CARE: - Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out at your 2-week follow up appointment. - Splint must be left on until follow up appointment unless otherwise instructed - Do NOT get splint wet - Please keep leg elevated AT ALL TIMES unless using restroom, etc. This is extremely important to prevent additional swelling which can cause wound breakdown and dangerous infection in your ankle that may be limb threatening.
