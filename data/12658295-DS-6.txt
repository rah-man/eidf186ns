___ BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING EMERGENCY WARD ___ BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING EMERGENCY WARD 

___ Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there has been drainage of some of the pleural fluid at the left base, with a substantial residual.  Underlying compressive atelectasis is seen. No evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung remains essentially clear. 

___ Cardiology ECHO  ___ Suboptimal mages. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened (mild posterior leaflet prolapse may be present). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. 

___ Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)  IMPRESSION: Stable large left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Stable small right pleural effusion. 

___ Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)  IMPRESSION: Unchanged large left pleural effusion and smaller right pleural effusion. No new pulmonary infiltrates. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ male s/p CABG in ___ with h/o L-sided pleural effusion drained ___ (Gram stain neg) presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath, and recurrent L-sided pleural effusion.

# Pleural effusion/SOB: The patient presented with recurrence of left-sided pleural effusion with symptoms of chest pain/pressure. In the ED, he received ASA325. Ruled out with cardiac biomarkers for ACS. Given recent h/o CABG, most likely concerning for post-pericardiotomy syndrome, however, assessed for potential CHF exacerbation with TTEd demonstrating a preserved LVEF. The patient was treated with IV Lasix which achieved significant diuresis and improvement in SOB symptoms, and this was converted to oral lasix. The patient underwent a thoracentesis with IP without complications, during which 1500ml of dark amber fluid was removed. Follow-up CXR demonstrated decrease in size of fluid collection, though substantial residual, without evidence of pneumothorax. In addition to lasix, the patient was started on colchicine, titrated up to 0.6 mg tid, during admission with NSAIDs held for post-pericardiotomy syndrome.

# CAD/CP: Pt with known 3-vessel disease s/p CABG reports cp/sob with activity (ambulating ___ resolved quickly at rest. Ruled out acute MI with serial cardiac biomarkers. ECG unchanged from prior. ECHO demonstrated moderate, circumferential pericardial effusion. Continued on Amiodarone 200mg QD, statin, and started on Colchicine for pain control titrated up to 0.6mg TID. Patient to continue on colchicine as outpatient.

# DM 2: Not active issue. Held Actos in-house. Started on HISS. FSBG wnl.

# Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during admission.

 Discharge Instructions: 1. You were admitted to the ___ complaining of increased chest pain and shortness of breath. You had a known recurrent Left-sided pleural effusion. We gave you Lasix to reduce the fluid collection in your lungs. You responded very well to the Lasix. You were also seen by the interventional pulmonary team, and underwent thoracentesis to drain the fluid collection around your lung. You did very well during this procedure. We gave you Benzonate for your cough. You responded very well to this medication.

2. We were able to rule out acute cardiac event (heart attack) as a cause of your chest pain symptoms. You had an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) and were found to have a fluid collection around your heart. We gave you Colchicine to manage the pain associated with the fluid around your heart. You responded very well to this medication. You will have to have a repeat echocardiogram to be scheduled by your primary care physician or cardiologist. 

3. Several changes were made to your at-home medications. The directions for medication changes are as follows: -Add Colchicine - Please take 1 tablet (0.6mg) three times per day -Add Lasix - Please take 1 tablet (20mg) every morning -Add Benzonate - Take 1 tablet for cough as needed up to 3 times daily. - Stop Ibuprofen

4. Unless otherwise indicated, you should resume all of your other at-home medications as taken prior to admission.
