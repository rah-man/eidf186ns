She reports that she lost 1lb with that diuresis but subsequently gained it back the following day.

Two nights prior to presentation, she developed acute onset nausea, diaphoresis, and "wooziness," which upon further questioning the patient stating felt somewhat like lightheadedness. In the ED, she reported that this may have been associated with some chest pressure though she did not think so by the time she got to the floor. She denies dyspnea, arm pain, and jaw pain. The episode was self resolving after a few minutes

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Follow-up with outpatient cardiology for possible aortic valve replacement. Patient found to have severe aortic stenosis, largely unchanged since ___ TTE. [ ] Check Cr in one week. [ ] Follow-up on diabetes management. Patient was on SSI during admission with BGs in mid-high 200s. - Discharge weight: 179.2 lb, discharge Cr: 2.4 - Patient was evaluated by physical therapy with recommendation for discharge to rehab, which patient declined. She was offered home physical therapy on discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Subacute on chronic HFpEF ___ LVEF 75%) Weight gain had been ongoing for several weeks-months and diuresis as an outpatient has been limited by rising Cr in the setting of CKD. He was diuresed with IV Lasix in the CDAC last week without significant improvement in weights, symptoms. Initially diuresed with Lasix 120 BID this admission, though discontinued diuresis on ___ due to Cr elevations. Home carvedilol 50 mg BID continued, and home losartan discontinued in setting of ___. Patient had euvolemic exam prior to discharge. TTE on ___ showed severe AS and. ___ RHC showed RA 2, RV 40/2, PA 22, PCWP 13, and mild pulmonary systolic hypertension. 

# Nausea, vomiting # Dizziness Patient presented complaining of episodes of N/V and dizziness. No arrhythmias noted on telemetry, and pacemaker interrogation on ___ showed no events. Low concern for infectious etiology. Patient had positive orthostatic vital signs during admission, likely in the setting of overdiuresis. Episodes may also be explained by patient's moderate-severe aortic stenosis.

# ___ on CKD Cr uptrending over the past 6 months from 2.0 to high 2-low 3. Initially uptrended with diuresis as high as 3.0. Cr downtrended to 2.4 prior to discharge in the setting of holding diuresis (___-). 

# Hypertension Antihypetensive regimen had recently been adjusted as an outpatient, complicated by uptrending Cr. Losartan discontinued ___ due to ___. Increased home carvedilol to 50 mg BID and continued home amlodipine 10 mg as an inpatient.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: ===================== # Mod-Severe AS Recent TTE with EF 75% and aortic velocity 3.6m/sec. Per outpatient notes, some discrepancy between recent TTEs with regard to moderate or severe AS.

# CAD s/p PCI Most recently with DES x2 to RCA in ___. Patient denied chest pain symptoms. Continued pravastatin, carvedilol and aspirin during admission. Ranexa was discontinued.

# Tachy/___ syndrome s/p PPM History of atrial fibrillation now s/p PPM in ___. No events on pacemaker interrogation ___. Apixiban held ___ prior to RHC. Carvedilol continued throughout admission.

# COPD/interstitial lung disease Followed by Dr. ___. Anoro ellipta nonformulary, so combivent given during this admission. Albuterol PRN continued during admission.

# Hypothyroidism Continued levothyroxine 100mcg daily

# DMII Diet controlled. A1c 6.6 on presentation. On SSI during admission.

# PVD Continued home aspirin, statin.
