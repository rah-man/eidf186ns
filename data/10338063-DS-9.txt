RADIOLOGY: MRI/MRA 1. Mildly limited study (V3 and V4 not well seen), but without infarct or filling defect to suggest clot. 2. Atherosclerosis. 3. Heterogeneous enlarged left lobe of the thyroid; recommend ultrasound for further workup. . CT c-spine: 1. No acute fractures or alignment abnormalities of the cervical spine. 2. Left thyroid goiter. Recommend clinical correlation and ultrasound if warranted clinically. . CT Head: No acute intracranial process. . TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a ___ y/o F hx labile HTN, numerous episodes of fall and LOC in setting of dizziness now presents with the same. .  # Vertigo/Dizziness: Pt at times endorses symptoms both of dizziness and vertigo.  She was evaluated by neurology on admission who felt this may represent a peripheral vestibular process. She had a head CT and MRI that was negative for any stroke or vascular anuerysm or process. Given her fall, she also had a C-spine CT that was negative for fracture. She was admitted to medicine and noted to be mildly orthostatic which improved with IVF hydration. On day of discharge, she did not have any orthostatic hypotension present. She was treated symptomatically with meclizine which mildly improved her symptoms. She was seen by physical therapy and found to be cleared with further ___ needs. However, given that she was having persistent symptoms of vertigo and dizziness, she felt unsafe to be at home alone. She was sent to a SNF for further care. Neurology recommended returning as an outpatient for tilt testing in the Autonomics lab which patient will have scheduled after discharge. .  # HTN:  At times has fluctuant BPs to the 190s which spontaneously resolve. No other symptoms to suggest clinical syndrome. She was previously on medications for BP although her BPs in the hospital have been in the 130s-140s range. No medications were started during this admission. . # Heterogenous Thyroid: Found incidentally on MRI/A of head. Outpatient thryoid ultrasound is recommended - please help patient arrange through her PCP. . DISPO - Patient discharged to nursing facility with follow up needed in ___ clinic.  Medications on Admission:  none currently, but 6 months ago pt was on:  lisinopril 5 mg daily  norvasc 2.5 mg daily  calcium
