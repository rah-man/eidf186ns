 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were transferred to ___ and admitted to the general surgery service with concern for an infection of your gallbladder. You received IV antibiotics and underwent removal of your gallbladder by the surgery service. You tolerated the procedure well and it was uncomplicated. You are now taking a regular diet. You are being discharged home in stable condition. You no longer need to take any additional antibiotics. You should follow up in general surgery clinic in two weeks. 

Please follow the discharge instructions below:

ACTIVITY: - Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and feel you could respond in an emergency. - You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several times a day. - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as tolerated. - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common sense and go slowly at first. - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: - You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS: - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. - After removal of your gallbladder, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluids and it will often resolve on its own. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT: - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated. - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
