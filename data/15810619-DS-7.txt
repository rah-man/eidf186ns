MICRO ----- BLOOD CULTURE ___: pending URINE CULTURE ___: pending

IMAGING ------- ___ CTA: FINDINGS: Although this study is not designed for assessment of intra-abdominal structures, the visualized solid organs and stomach are unremarkable.   CT chest: The thyroid is unremarkable and there is no supraclavicular lymph node enlargement. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. There is mild cardiomegaly. The patient is status post median sternotomy with post surgical changes in the mediastinum. The native vessels demonstrate severe atherosclerotic disease. The pulmonary artery is dilated to 4 cm consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension. No hiatal hernia or other esophageal abnormality is present. 

There is a 5 mm nodule in the left lower lobe (2:64). A linear opacity at the left lung base most likely represents scarring. Emphysematous changes are noted. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.   CTA chest: The aorta and major thoracic vessels are well opacified. The aorta demonstrates normal caliber throughout the thorax without intramural hematoma or dissection. The pulmonary arteries are opacified to the subsegmental level. There is no filling defect in the main, right, left, lobar or subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Osseous structures: No lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy is present.   IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. 5 mm nodule in the left lower lobe. Consider follow up in ___ year if no prior studies exist for comparison. 3. Pulmonary artery hypertension 4. Emphysema. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ year old female with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG ___, gout, EPO resistant anemia, ESRD on ___ HD who presents after a syncopal episode at HD ___. 

# Syncope: Pt with witnessed syncopal episode in post HD setting without associated trauma. Seems most likely to be orthostatic given setting of post-HD and +orthostatics here. On dihydropyridine CCB which increases risk. Resolved orthostatics with 250mL bolus. History not consistent with seizure or CVA. Negative for acute coronary syndrome. CTA negative for PE. No arrythmia on EKG or telemetry. This was likely provoked by the patient being slightly hypovolemic after HD, partially from minimal PO intake in the 12 hours prior to HD. Her estimated dry weight from last admission was 68.5 kg. She weighed 64.5 kg at discharge. Patient thinks her dry wt around 140lbs. Consideration may be given to an alternative antihypertensive with mortality benefit in CAD (such as a beta-blocker). 

#. Lung nodule: 5 mm nodule incidentally identified in the left lower lobe.  - will need follow up CT in one year 

#. ESRD: Pt with left AV fistula on ___ HD. Outpatient dialysis unit:The ___. Outpatient ___ ___. Last full HD was today. She was continued on calcium acetate and nephrocaps with a 2 gram potassium and sodium diet. Next HD will be ___. Her estimated dry weight from last admission was 68.5 kg. She weighed 64.5 kg at discharge. Patient thinks her dry wt around 140lbs. 

#. CAD: Pt is s/p CABG (SVG to LAD and SVG to ramus), last cath ___ with 60% ulcerated left main, 30% ___ and 30% mid LAD, 30% mid LCx, 60% OM1, 30% mid RCA (right dominant). Not currently on beta-blocker or ___. Home package: ASA 81', atorva 40', nifedipine XL 30mg q ___. Had 3 sets of enzymes with stable elevated troponins in setting of ESRD but no EKGs changes and flat CKMBs. We continued aspirin 81mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily, and nifedipine. ___ consider beta-blocker for secondary MI prevention as an outpatient.   #. Anemia: Likely from ESRD. Thought to be EPO resistant given high doses during HD with relative anemia. Pt with H/H of 10.5/34.9 which is up from H/H of 7.9/ 26.9 on prior discharge. No transfusion required this admission.

#. Bone/Mineral: Ca ___. Nephrology holding calcitriol. Phos slightly high. Home calcium acetate was continued. The patient may benefit from reduced calcitriol or a non-calcium phosphorus binder if persistently elevated.   #. Access: LUE AVF  #. Code status this admission: DNR/DNI, consistent with prior

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -f/u CT in 12 months for 5mm pulmonary nodule in left lower lobe (patient counseled about this) -consider less aggressive volume removal during HD as she was under her nominal dry weight at BID -consider changing antihypertensive to reduce risk of orthostasis and for better CAD secondary prevention  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Allopurinol ___ mg PO DAILY 2. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 3. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY 4. Calcium Acetate 1334 mg PO HS 5. Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY 6. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO QPM 7. Nitroglycerin SL 0.3 mg SL PRN chest pain 

 Discharge Medications: 1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 2. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY 3. Calcium Acetate 1334 mg PO HS 4. Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY 5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO QPM 6. Nitroglycerin SL 0.3 mg SL PRN chest pain 7. Allopurinol ___ mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: #End stage renal disease #Orthostatic hypotension #Anemia #Coronary artery disease #Pulmonary nodule, left lower lobe  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___, you were admitted to the hospital after having an episode of fainting after dialysis. We found that you did not have evidence for a heart attack and that you did not have clots in your lungs, both of which can sometimes cause your blood pressure to drop. Your blood pressure was a little low when you were here, and dropped when you stood up. We think this is because you were slightly dehydrated. We gave you a small amount of fluid and your blood pressure improved. Your blood pressure medication may cause this as a side-effect, but we still feel that it is necessary.  Followup Instructions: ___
