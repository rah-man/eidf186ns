___ CT abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence of active arterial extravasation. 2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 3. Intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilation with CBD dilation to 21-mm is new from ___. 4. Enlarging enhancing left renal lesion is concerning for renal cell carcinoma. 

___ EUS: The ampulla was viewed with the linear echoendoscope and was normal. EUS: The common bile duct was dilated to at least 1cm although EUS can understimate CBD diameter. Within the distal CBD there was a small non-shadowing filling defect within the duct that measured 4.1 mm in one plane. This could be consistent with a CBD polyp versus a tortuous S-shaped distal common bile duct. The pancreas was normal in the head. It was hyperechoic in the body and tail consistent with fatty pancreas. The pancreatic duct was normal and nondilated. The ampulla was normal. The visualized liver (left lobe) was normal. No ___, porta hepatis, gastro-hepatic or celiac lymphadenopathy was seen. Otherwise normal upper eus to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Given EUS findings, recommend ERCP for further evaluation.

___ ERCP: Normal major papilla Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Dilatation of the CBD to 12mm and mild dilatation of the main intrahepatic bile ducts. No filling defect in the CBD. Sphincterotomy and balloon sweeps with extraction of sludge. The dilatation of the biliary tree was probably due to a long intraduodenal segment of the papilla which was somewhat stenotic. Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, there are somewhat lower lung volumes. Some coarse interstitial markings are seen at the bases and there is again flattening of the hemidiaphragms, all consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. No definite acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ yoF with h/o CAD, HTN, HL, renal cell carcinoma and CKD who presents after ERCP, found to have common bile duct dilation.

# CBD dilation: Found to have a dilated common bile duct on ERCP, likely related to stenosis of papilla. She had sphincterotomy performed without complication. She was kept NPO overnight and diet was advanced without complication. At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet.

# Hypoxemia: The day after her ERCP she developed hypoxemia to the high 80's on room air, which improved with ___ O2. She remained asymptomatic. CXR showed chronic pulmonary changes without acute process. Given that her hypoxia developed after receiving aggressive IV fluids after ERCP, she was given a dose of lasix and her hypoxia improved somewhat. She was 93% on room air at the time of discharge and remained asymptomatic. She should follow-up with her PCP for recheck and potentially further workup of her lung disease. She does have a history of COPD but had no wheezing on exam. She was kept on her home COPD meds.  # Renal cell carcinoma: Managed expectantly as outpatient.  Should have urology follow-up

# CAD: s/p NSTEMI ___, medically managed: Recently seen by cardiology, no longer on Plavix given recent GI bleed. Held aspirin during this admission given her sphincterotomy, but it can be restarted in 5 days Continued her home beta blocker, ACE, and statin.

# HTN: Continued home ACE, BB, CCB. Thiazide was held during this admission and restarted at discharge.

# CKD: Recent baseline creatinine 1.3, was 1.1 on this admission.

# Osteoporosis: Given calcium/vitamin D

# GERD: Home ranitidine

# Anemia: Home iron

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin

CODE: Full code, confirmed EMERGENCY CONTACT: HCP is husband ___ (___), secondary is daughter ___ ___ or ___

 Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

You were admitted to the hospital after ERCP for monitoring.  Your ERCP was uncomplicated and you were found to have a stenosis (narrowing) of your biliary duct which was treated with a procedure called a sphincterotomy to open up the narrowing.  You tolerated the procedure well without complications. You were tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge.

The oxygen level in your blood was also found to be low after the procedure and you were kept in the hospital for this reason.  It improved by the time of discharge. It is important that you weigh yourself every morning, and call your primary care doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs.  Followup Instructions: ___
