CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 2:54 ___ 1. Early high-grade small-bowel obstruction at the level of the ileal anastomosis in the right lower quadrant. 2.

Interval improvement in appearances with decrease in degree of small-bowel obstruction. Oral contrast has passed through the ileoileal anastomosis to the cecum. 2.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to vascular surgery and maintained on IV heparin. He was put in a compression wrap and started on a bicarb drip with preperations for angiogram and thrombolysis. A head CT was done to rule out any acute process prior to angiogram. On ___ he was taken to the angio suite where he underwent: 1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of right jugular vein. 2. Inferior vena cava venography. 3. Placement of infrarenal inferior vena cava filter. 4. Ultrasound-guided puncture of right popliteal vein. 5. Right lower extremity venography. 6. AngioJet thrombolysis of right lower extremity and right   iliac vein. 7. Balloon angioplasty of right common femoral vein and   right iliac vein. 8. Stenting of right iliac vein. (see OP note for full details) 

He tolerated the procedure well and was continued on a heparin drip. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells for acute blood loss anemia. On POD 1 his diet was advanced and he was doing well. He was continued on his home pain regimen of oxycontin 10mg bid and oxycodone prn for breakthrough pain. In the evening of POD 1 his heparin drip was stopped, and therapeutic lovenox - coumadin bridge initiated. His diet was advanced, but he did not tolerate it well, becoming quite nauseseated with vomitting. KUB showed an ileus, and his narcotics were stopped and enemas given. He continued to have symptoms and a CT scan with gastrografin was done. This showed early high-grade small-bowel obstruction at the level of the ileal anastomosis in the right lower quadrant. ACS was consulted and an NG tube placed on ___. Mr. ___ showed great improvement over the next ___ hours and his NG tube was removed late on ___. He began to make steady improvement. His diet was slowly advanced and he eventually toelrated a regular diet, having regular bowel movements. His INR was montiored closely, and did become supratherapeutic, causing us to hold his coumadin for several days. He was taking tylenol around the clock, but did develop some pain which required narcotics to manange. Over the next few days he got a few doses of IV dilaudid which controlled his pain well and didn't seem to cause constipation. He continued to make steady progress, ambulating independenly with good pain control. On ___ he was deemed stable for discharge home. His pain had been well controlled with tylenol and ___ doses of 0.25mg of IV dilaudid, so we talked with the pain team, the pt and his family and decided to send him out on 4g of tylenol per day, with dilaudid 2mg po as needed for pain. Given his history of constipation and ileus, he is instructed to take senna and colace daily, with miralax and/or lactulose on days he uses narcotics. His INR was 2.0 on the day of discharge and he was sent on 3mg of coumadin. His INR will be followed by the ___ clinic. He will follow up with his oncology team on ___, and with the vascular team in a week.
