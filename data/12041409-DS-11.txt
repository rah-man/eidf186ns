Microbiology: ============= Blood Culture x2 ___: RP Lyme ___: negative C Diff ___: 

Imaging: ======== CTA chest @ ___  IMPRESSION: Large pericardial effusion and mild pericardial  thickening of concern for tamponade and or pericarditis. Evidence of  diminished cardiac output. No pulmonary emboli are seen. Some peripheral vessels in the right lung base are unenhanced but this is less likely due to thrombus. The central pulmonary arteries enhance homogeneously. No evidence of dissection or aneurysm. Small amount of ascites. Thick-walled gallbladder with adjacent edema. There is also periportal edema and edema in the epigastric region. This may relate to heart failure. Cholecystitis cannot be excluded. 

TTE ___ The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. With inspiration, the interventricular septum moves towards the left ventricle, suggestive of hemodynamic RV-LV interdependence. The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction. 

IMPRESSION: Small echodense pericardial effusion. No signs of tamponade physiology. RV-LV interdependence suggested (effusive-constrictive physiology). 

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, similar to outside hospital studies, and new mild pulmonary edema.  

RUQ U/S ___ IMPRESSION:   1. Non-specific gallbladder wall edema which can be seen in third-spacing and hepatitis. No cholelithiasis or other sonographic features to support cholecystitis. 2. Bilateral pleural effusions.  CXR ___ Heart size, mediastinal pulmonary vascular engorgement, and pulmonary edema are decreased from ___. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. 

TTE ___ The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is a very small to small pericardial effusion, measuring from 0.3 cm up to 0.8 cm. The effusion appears circumferential with preferential fluid deposition anteriorly. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. 

IMPRESSION: Very small to small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the overall findings are similar. The RV-LV interdependence that was previously suggested (effusive-constrictive physiology) was not able to be adequately assessed on today's study.  

EKG (___): Sinus rhythm. Diffuse low QRS voltage. Cannot exclude anterior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Diffuse non-specific repolarization abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.

 Brief Hospital Course: Summary: ======== ___ M with history of HLD wjp receives most of his care at the ___ presents from ___ s/p needle pericardiocentesis for pericardial tamponade. 

# CORONARIES: unknown # PUMP: EF 55% # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm

Acute Issues: ============= # Pericarditis w/Pericardial Tamponade s/p pericardial tap: Patient presented to OSH with DOE and chest discomfort in the setting of recent cough, SOB, and treatment with Doxycycline. OSH CTA demonstrated large pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening with concern for tamponade. Patient underwent needle pericardiocentesis with removal of 85 cc of fluid and symptomatic improvement. Patient was transferred to ___ and admitted to CCU for monitoring. Etiology of pericardial effusion was felt to be viral in etiology and ibuprofen and colchicine were started for pericarditis. However, fluid removed at OSH was not sent for cultures or cytology thus a malignant effusion cannot be excluded, particularly given patient's reported night sweats. Patient reported that he was up to date with colonoscopy with no abnormal findings. Active smoker but reports recent chest CT at PCP that also showed no abnormal findings, along with CT-A at ___ w/o acute findings. TSH was wnl, ___ however was highly positive at 1:320 in speckled pattern. C/F autoimmune disorder with highly positive ___, further Rheum studies were sent, showed elevated CRP 71, mild high RF of 16. Remaining rheumatologic studies pending at time of discharge. 

# Afib w/RVR: Patient developed sudden onset ASx Afib with RVR on ___. Initially controlled on IV Metop, transitioned to PO Metop, later requiring Dilt gtt for control. Had softer BPs while in RVR, but remained ASx. Was transitioned from PO Metop to PO Dilt for better control. Was started on heparin gtt for AC in preparation DC cardioversion on ___ but patient spontaneous reverted to sinus rhythm Will continue on diltiazem ER 180 mg as outpatient until told to DC per Cards. Given return to normal sinus rhythm, low CHADS score, and initiation of ibuprofen for pericarditis, did not discharge on anticoagulation.

# Chest Pain Felt to be secondary to pericarditis. EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Troponin negative x2. Patient started on colchicine BID and ibuprofen TID with improvement in chest pain, continued on discharge

#? PNA No evidence of PNA on CTA, and patient's sx worsened when Rx'd doxycycline. Repeat CXRs here w/o signs of PNA

# Transaminitis No known history of liver disease. CTA did show small amount of ascites and a thick-walled gallbladder with adjacent edema. T bili within normal limits, no pain concerning for cholecystitis. LFTs improved over admission, RUQ U/S showed mild GB edema and ascites, most likely iso fluid overload due to constrictive physiology ___ pericarditis.

# Hypervolemia: Pt with orthopnea/cough, elevated JVP, dyspnea, mild O2 requirement. Pulm edema on CXR, mildly elevated BNP. TTE showed mild stable pericardial effusion w/constrictive physiology, LVEF wnl. Gently diuresed with IV Lasix, transitioned to PO furosemide 20 mg qD for maintanence diuresis.

Chronic Issues: =============== # HLD: continued on home ___ 81

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== -Would advise repeat RUQ U/S and LFTs as outpatient to ensure that GB edema/ascites had resolved -Pt will require comprehensive malignancy workup as an outpatient, as had night sweats and some possible weight loss before admission. Per pt, UTD on cancer screening. ___ did not send pericardial drained fluid for cytology, pleural effusions were thought to be risky to tap per Interventional Pulm considering risks vs benefits. Can f/u in ___ clinic as outpatient if PCP determines pleural effusions have enlarged or vital for Dx -Please f/u rheumatology w/u (DsDNA, anti-histone, scleroderma, Ro & La, RNP) and Quant gold -___ consider cardiac MRI for evaluation of constrictive physiology as outpatient -Will need repeat TTE in 1 month -Please repeat CRP, ESR in 1 week -Discharged on colchicine BID x 1 week (until ___, then decrease to daily. Started on ibuprofen TID and omeprazole -Discharged on Lasix 20mg po given pleural effusions on exam. Should be titrated as needed as an outpatient -Not started on anticoagulation given likely transient atrial fibrillation episode provoked by pericardial effusion/pericarditis and given initation of NSAIDs for pericarditis. Patient spontaneously returned to sinus rhythm prior to discharge on AM of ___ - Discharged on diltiazem ER 180 daily for episode of atrial fibrillation while in house. ___ consider downtitration/discontinuation as acute illness resolves.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after you were found to have a fluid in the sac that surrounds your heart (called a pericardial effusion). This fluid was drained at ___ ___ and you were then transferred here. We did several echocardiograms of your heart that showed there was only a small amount of fluid in that sac. We think that the fluid occurred as a reaction to a virus that you had before your admission. We were additionally concerned that you might have an "autoimmune" disorder. We checked some more of your bloodwork, which were still pending at the time of your discharge. Over your admission you also developed a fast irregular heart beat called "atrial fibrillation" -- we started you on several medications to help control your heart. You spontaneously returned to a normal heart rhythm on ___ 

You will be discharged on a medication called colchicine to treat the fluid around your heart. It should be taken twice a day until ___ and then begin taking just once a day or as otherwise directed by your doctor.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
