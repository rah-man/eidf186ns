Chief Complaint: Acute Pulmonary Embolus, Pericardial Effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None

 History of Present Illness: ___ year old Female who presents with progressive dyspnea, ultimately found with pericardial effusion and multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli. The patient reports at baseline she is very active, doing vigorous physical activity such as line dancing and at baseline has no problem accomplishing these activities. She reports over the month prior to admission she has been becoming progressivel short of breath with minimal activity and even sometimes at rest. 

She also reports some mild chest pressure, which is exertional in nature. She denies chest pain, cough, PND, pedal edema or orthopnea. She reports the pressure can radiate to her back, but never down the arm or to the jaw.

In the ED she was initially ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her EKG was somewhat concerning for dynamic changes, which have since normalized. She also underwent a stress test, which was negative with a poor DWP. She also underwent a CTA scan of the chest which was notable for multple subsegmental PEs and a small pericardial effusion  Past Medical History: Benign Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Cholelithiasis s/p cholecystectomy Chronic Anemia  Pulmonary Nodules, s/p resection at ___ ___, pt states benign and a current one being monitored Hysterectomy  glucose intolerance  Social History: ___ Family History: Brother: Lung CA, MI Mother: CVA Father: CVA  Physical Exam: ROS: GEN: - fevers, - Chills, - Weight Loss EYES: - Photophobia, - Visual Changes HEENT: - Oral/Gum bleeding CARDIAC: + Chest Pressur, - Chest Pain, - Palpitations, - Edema GI: - Nausea, - Vomitting, - Diarhea, - Abdominal Pain, - Constipation, - Hematochezia PULM: + Dyspnea, - Cough, - Hemoptysis HEME: - Bleeding, - Lymphadenopathy GU: - Dysuria, - hematuria, - Incontinence SKIN: - Rash ENDO: - Heat/Cold Intolerance MSK: - Myalgia, - Arthralgia, - Back Pain NEURO: - Numbness, - Weakness, - Vertigo, - Headache  ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: ===================================== VSS: 97.6, 132/70, 64, 18, 95% GEN: NAD, Obese Pain: ___ HEENT: EOMI, MMM, - OP Lesions PUL: Feint basilar crackles COR: RRR, S1/S2, ___ SEM RSB ABD: NT/ND, +BS, - CVAT EXT: - CCE NEURO: CAOx3, Non-Focal

Pertinent Studies: ECG Study Date of ___ 2:45:50 ___ Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial abnormality.

Imaging: ==================== CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 4:23 ___ IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with trace bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia. Surgical clips within left upper lobe.    Stress Study Date of ___  IMPRESSION: Non-anginal type symptoms in the absence of ischemic EKG changes. Exertional dyspnea at low workload. Ectopy as noted.  

TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:33:27 AM Conclusions  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Cardiomegaly and a small pericardial effusion. 3. Right upper lobe 8-mm nodule for which followup CT in six months, or three months if that patient has risk factors, is recommended to document stability. 4. Hiatal hernia.

Discharge Labs: ================== ___ 07:10AM BLOOD ___ PTT-40.5* ___  Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ is a ___ y/o F with h/o HTN, HLD, and pulmonary nodules s/p resection in ___ who presented to ED with increased dyspnea and found to have small pericardial effusion, small PEs, and 8mm RUL long nodule.

Active Issues: ========================= 1. Acute Pulmonary Emboli: Patient was sent to the ED from PCP for increasing dyspnea. Initially, cardiac sources for her dyspnea were entertained as she had EKG with TWI in V4-V5 and had negative cardiac enzymes x2. She underwent a stress test that was a limited study secondary to dyspnea. She underwent a CTA on ___ that revealed pulmonary emboli as well small pericardial effusion. Initially, there was concern that the pericardial effusion could be hemorrhagic, however after discussion with radiology, the houndsfield units are not consistent with blood. The etiology of her PE currently is unknown. It appears to be an unprovoked PE, thus requiring 6 months of anticoagulation as patient is up to date on colonoscopy and mammaography, but cannot rule out another occult malignancy during this admission. She was started on lovenox as a bridge to coumadin.

2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient was noted to have a pericardial effusion on her CTA scan. At that time, a pulsus was measured to be <10. On ___ she had a TTE performed that did not show tamponade physiology and noted to have EF>55% with mild aortic stenosis.

Chronic Issues: ================================ 3. Anemia: baseline around 34-36 since ___. Her hematocrit remained stable around her baseline during this admission.  4. Benign Hypertension: She was continued on her home ___ and amlodipine. 

5. Hyperlipidemia: she was continued on her home Crestor. 

Transitional Issues: ========================= #. Right middle lobe 8-mm nodule for which followup CT in six months, or three months if that patient has risk factors, is recommended to document stability. #. Aortic Stenosis: aortic valve area 1.9cm2. #. Full Code  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care at ___ ___. You came to us with shortness of breath and chest discomfort, and we found that you have a blood clot in the lungs called a pulmonary embolism. While with us, we started you on medications to thin the blood and allow your body to reabsorb the clot. The enoxaparin (also known as lovenox) is to be given twice daily by injection, and the warfarin (also known as coumadin) is to be taken once daily by mouth. The coumadin medication requires close monitoring on initiation with serial blood tests, but you may be able to discontinue the lovenox under consultation with your PCP once the coumadin dosing is adjusted. Your primary care physician is arranging for their ___ clinic to contact you and initiate the close monitoring required.  Followup Instructions: ___
