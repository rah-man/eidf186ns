 History of Present Illness: ___ y/oM with PMH afib on coumadin, new onset RLE swelling, and imaging suggestive on likely metastatic prostate CA who presented to the ED with BRBPR. . Patient complains of intermittent BRBPR x 1 month which acutely worsened in the past several days to multiple frank bloody stools. No accompanying abdominal discomfort, fever or nausea/ vomiting. No history of GI bleed, but patient has a history of hemorrhoids and has never had a colonoscopy. Two days prior to admission, after talking to his PCP, patient stopped taking coumadin.  Notes fatigue but denies any accompanying chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness, or other complaints.  . Of note, this occurred in the setting of new onset lower extremity swelling with right > left. CT scan to further evaluate did not show any evidence of DVT but revealed large prostate mass with bulky lymphadenopathy causing hydronephrosis.  Although the patient was told that he probably has cancer, he does not know any further details of likely diagnosis. Over the past several days to weeks, he notes increasing back pain similar to prior exacerbation of spinal stenosis. He denies any associated saddle anesthesia or bowel incontinence but does have worsening urinary retention. .  In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 ___ 20 100. Labs were notable for Hct of 34.7 from recent Hct of 43.3 on ___, Cr 1.3 (baseline 0.8) and INR of 2.9. Patient typed and crossed, given 5mg vitamin K and 1 U FFP. ED course complicated by development of afib with HR in 150s and given metoprolol 25mg PO x 2. Admitted to the MICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.

Colonoscopy Findings:  Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.  Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole colon.  Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Diverticula and hemorrhoids noted. Given two month hx of rectal bleeding consideration of related to hemorrhoidal bleeding. Please return to ward for further recommendations. 

Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Findings:  Contents: Stool was found in the rectum and sigmoid colon.  Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.  Other Mild scope trauma visualized in the rectum. No source of hematochezia identified.  Impression: Stool in the rectum and sigmoid colon Mild scope trauma visualized in the rectum. No source of hematochezia identified. Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon at 40 cm Recommendations: Prostate palpable and firm on rectal examination. Limited study given stool but no active bleeding or lesion noted to 40 cm. Recommend Golytely prep for colonoscopy once stabilized. 

Bone Scan: INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections as well as spot images of the arms.  There is increased uptake at approximately L3 on the right and L5 on the left; on the CT of ___ there are degenerative changes in these locations which may account for these findings. The lumbar spine is partially obscured by activity in the ureters. There is increased uptake at approximately the ___ costovertebral junction on the right, likely degenerative. There are no other bony findings.  There is increased soft tissue uptake which may relate to edema.  The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion. The ureters are displaced medially and have intense tracer activity. A catheter is in place.  No previous studies for comparison.  IMPRESSION: Uptake in approximately L3, L5, and the ___ costovertebral junction, all of which may be accounted for by degenerative change. No other bony findings

CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Marked lymphadenopathy within the pelvis, with extension to abdominal lymph node chains as described above. There is associated bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Findings are highly concerning for metastatic lymphadenopathy, and differential considerations include lymphoma and prostate carcinoma, given the enlarged and heterogeneous appearance of the prostate. 2. Colonic diverticulosis. 3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. 4. No evidence of bowel obstruction, as questioned.

KUB: FINDINGS: A single supine portable view of the abdomen was obtained. There are many non-dilated gas-filled loops of jejunum and ileum, stacked on the left side of the abdomen. Gas is seen within the rectum with little gas in the remainder of the colon. The pattern is concerning for early or partial obstruction. A high-density oval structure in the right lower quadrant is likely retained contrast in the cecum or barium in a giant cecal diverticulum. CT could be considered to evaluate if this is a cause of obstruction. Gallstone ileus is unlikely given the lack of air in the biliary tree and the appearance of this density. Retained contrast is seen in small scattered diverticula in the descending colon.  IMPRESSION: Pattern concerning for early or partial obstruction, less likely gallstone ileus. Obstruction might be caused by retained contrast in the cecum or a large cecal diverticulum.

___: FINDINGS:  Grayscale and Doppler images of the right and left common femoral, right superficial femoral, right popliteal were obtained. There was normal compressibility, wall-to-wall flow with normal response to augmentation throughout. The calf veins were not definitely seen. Subcutaneous edema is noted along the calf.  IMPRESSION:  No DVT in right lower extremity.

EKG ___: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Borderline low limb lead voltage. Leftward axis. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of ___ the rate is faster

___: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. Low voltage in the limb leads. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no diagnostic change

Colonoscopy to cecum showed no active bleeding, but did reveal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. Patient did have 2 episodes of mild BRBPR while on the floor with bowel movements thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids and straining with bowel movements. Started on bowel regimen including colace, fiber, and senna PRN. . # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Initially elevated HR to 160s, treated with fluids and esmolol drip in ICU. Weaned to home medications of metoprolol and diltiazem. Patient was tachycardic with ambulation so metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID. . # Urinary Retention: Initial attempt at foley insertion was unsuccessful and caused bleeding from urethral meatus. Urology consulted and inserted coude catheter. Foley was removed 3 days prior to d/c, however patient was having frequent small voids thought to be overflow. A post void bladder scan revealed 950cc of urine so Urology replaced foley. Dishcarged with foley in place and started on tamsulosin with Urology follow-up. . # Presumed metastatic Prostate cancer: CT scan in ___ showing enlarged prostatic mass, bulky lymphadenopathy obscuring neurovasculature (likely cause of RLE edema), and likely liver mets. Oncology was consulted and recommended degarelix which patient received while in house. Radiation-Oncology was consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. A bone scan was done which showed no bony lesions. . # Psoriasis - Did flare while in hospital, but resolved once patient applied home steroid ointment.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

 It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization. You were admitted with bleeding from your rectum. You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a colonoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding. It was thought the bleeding is due to your hemorrhoids. We started you an a bowel regimen which should soften your stool and help you move your bowels without straining.  You were seen by an Oncologist and were treated with a medication, degarelix, that will help treat your cancer. We do not think that you need to be on coumadin for your atrial fibrillation as you are low risk for a stroke.  You are going home with a foley as we did a post void bladder scan which showed 950cc of urine in your bladder. We added a medication, tamsulosin, that should help shrink the prostate and make it easier to urinate. You will follow up with the Urologists in 1 week to help with the foley.

We made the following changes to your medication: STOPPED Coumadin

INCREASED Metoprolol to 75mg TID

STARTED Colace 100mg by mouth twice daily Tamsulosin 0.4mg by mouth nightly

Please eat a high fiber diet, including adding Metamucil, three times a day. You can add an over-the-counter medication, Senna, to your regimen if you find you are still straining with your bowel movements.

Please follow up with your scheduled appointments. You can discuss with Dr. ___ switching the metoprolol and diltiazem to long acting forms.  Followup Instructions: ___
