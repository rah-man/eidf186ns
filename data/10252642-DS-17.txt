 Discharge Instructions: ======================  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS  ======================  Dear ___ was a privilege caring for you at ___. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  - You were in the hospital because your thyroid was overactive. You were experiencing symptoms including a fast heart rate.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  - In the hospital, we performed several tests to determine the cause of your overactive thyroid. These included several blood tests, an ultrasound of your thyroid, and a radioactive iodine uptake imaging study. The results of these tests were consistent with thyroiditis secondary to your amiodarone medication. Thyroid dysfunction is a rare but known side effect of amiodarone that may appear weeks to months after cessation of the drug. You were treated with a higher dose propranolol to control your heart rate as well as methimazole and prednisone to reduce the activity of your thyroid.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  - Please continue to take all of your medications and ___ with your appointments as listed below.

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely,  Your ___ Team   Followup Instructions: ___
