IMAGING ======= MRI C and T spine ___. Study is moderately degraded by motion. 2. T2, T7 and T12 chronic anterior compression deformities. 3. Within limits of study, no definite evidence of acute cervical or thoracic fracture or ligamentous injury. 4. Within limits of study, no definite evidence of cervical or thoracic spinal cord lesion or abnormal enhancement. 5. Multilevel cervical and thoracic spondylosis as described, without definite evidence of moderate or severe vertebral canal narrowing. 6. Question history of vertebroplasty of T10 through L3 vertebral bodies. 7. Incomplete evaluation of left renal lesions suggestive of cysts. If concern for renal masses, consider contrast renal MRI for further evaluation. 

Chest PA and Lat ___. Increased interstitial lung markings in both lungs which could represent progressed chronic interstitial lung disease and/or mild pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease. 2. Irregular linear opacities in both lower lobes which could represent atelectasis, scarring, or pneumonia. 

TTE ___ IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mild regional systolic dysfunction (see schematic) in the setting of globally preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and low normal right ventricular function. Normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valves.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of rheumatic heart disease s/p AVR/MVR bioproesthetic valves ___, MVR in ___, afib on warfarin, HTN, DM2 presented with after falling at home. In the ED, she was also noted to have acute heart failure exacerbation requiring admission and IV diuresis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ===================== [ ] Diuretics - patient was discharged on her home diuretic regimen (40mg PO daily). This can be titrated based on weights/labs as an outpatient. [ ] Tricuspid regurgitation - noted to have moderate-severe TR on TTE, which should be followed up by her PCP. [ ] ?Interstitial lung disease - CXR showed interstitial markings that may represent chronic interstitial lung process that can be further evaluated as an outpatient [ ] Left renal cyst - MRI showed incomplete evaluation of left renal lesions suggestive of cysts. Can consider contrast renal MRI in the future if concerned for renal mass. [ ] Code status - Family in the process of discussing code status, which should continue as an outpatient. [ ] INR - Patient will check INR with home Alere device on ___ and call ___ for dose adjustments.

ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== #Fall with headstrike Patient reports bending over to pick up a flower and becoming dizzy upon standing upright, prompting her to fall and hit her head on the house. She did not lose consciousness and denied any precedent chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Patient was brought to ___ where a CT head showed "nondisplaced fracutre of L occipital condyle." She was transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation, where an MRI C and T spine showed chronic multilevel degenerative changes without acut fracture. Neurosurgery was also consulted who agreed that the patient did not have a cervical spine fracture. Evaluation of her fall included telemetry monitoring (negative), troponins (negative), and TTE (see below). While in the ED, however, she received IVF and was noted to be dyspneic and hypoxic, prompting admission to medicine for heart failure exacerbation. ___ evaluated her throughout her admission and deemed her appropriate for discharge home with home ___.

#Acute on chronic heart failure with recovered ejection fraction Patient became dyspneic and hypoxic in the ED after receiving IVF. She was admitted to the medicine service for heart failure exacerbation. She was diuresed with IV Lasix for two days and then transitioned back to her home diuretic (PO Lasix 4omg daily). A repeat TTE showed biatrial enlargement, mild regional systolic dysfunction in the setting of globally preserved left ventricular systolic function, moderate to severe TR< and mild pulmonary hypertension. Her EF was ~55%. In addition to preload reduction with diuretics, she was continued on her lisinopril 5mg PO daily and metoprolol succinate 75mg daily.

CHRONIC ISSUES: ================ #Atrial fibrillation CHADS2VASC 6 (age, female, CHF, HTN, DM). INR 1.7 on admission. Warfarin was dosed by level and she was therapeutic on discharge. She was continued on her metoprolol, as above.

#Dementia: Continued donepezil.
