¨   Your staples should stay clean and dry until they are removed. They will be removed in the OR at the time of your second surgery.

¨   Have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily. 

¨   Take your pain medicine as prescribed if needed. You do not need to take it if you do not have pain.

¨   Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10 lbs, straining, or excessive bending.

¨   Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.

¨   DO not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc. until follow up.

¨   You were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin, do not take this at all before your second Stage surgery.
