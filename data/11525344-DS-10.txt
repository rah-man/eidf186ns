The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen (other than atrial fibrillation). Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle. Right ventricular hypertrophy with borderline dilation, normal function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS ___: HISTORY: ___ female with left leg paresthesias and outside hospital arterial ultrasound demonstrating left femoral artery thrombosis. Assess for occlusion. COMPARISON: None available  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the toes were displayed with 2.5- and 5-mm slice thickness.  Initial axial images were acquired in a non-contrast phase followed by arterial phase imaging. Delayed phase imaging through the lower extremities was also performed. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared. CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear without confluent consolidation or pleural effusion. There is a small pericardial effusion. Otherwise, the cardiac apex is within normal limits.  Within segment IVb of the liver is a too small to characterize hypodensity, which may represent a small cyst (3A:40). Also within segment IVb is a subcentimeter focus of arterial enhancement, a probable flash-filling hemangioma (3A:45). No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. There is focal cortical thinning within both kidneys, left greater than right, possibly secondary to prior infection or infarction. There is a too small to characterize hypodensity within the interpolar region of the left kidney, likely a cyst (3A:68). There is a 4.3 x 5.0 cm simple cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney and an adjacent subcentimeter ssimple cyst (3A:85). There is no hydronephrosis or suspicious renal mass.  The stomach and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. There is no abdominal free fluid or free air.  CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The appendix is visualized and is normal. Coarse calcifications are seen within the bilateral adnexae. No adnexal mass lesion is identified. The uterus is within normal limits. There is trace pelvic free fluid. The bladder is moderately distended and appears normal. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric, retroperitoneal, pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  CTA: The abdominal aorta and its branch vessels demonstrate minimal atherosclerotic calcification, though are widely patent. The celiac axis demonstrates normal conventional arterial anatomy. There is minimal atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the SMA and calcifications of segmental branches. Minimal atherosclerotic plaque is seen at the takeoff of the right renal artery. The left renal artery origin is widely patent. The ___ is also widely patent. There is moderate soft and calcified plaque in the infrarenal abdominal aorta, though resulting in less than 20% luminal narrowing. The bilateral common iliac arteries demonstrate minimal atherosclerotic plaque, though are widely patent.  Bilateral internal and external iliac arteries are widely patent. LEFT: There is complete occlusion of the left common femoral artery (3A:168). Thrombus extends into the left superficial femoral artery, though with distal reconstitution ~7.7 cm above the knee. The left deep femoral artery and perforators are patent, likely secondary to collateral flow. The reconstituted distal left superficial femoral artery remains narrowed to the level of the popliteal artery. The left tibioperoneal trunk has non-occlusive thrombus within it, though there is preserved flow to the left posterior tibial and peroneal arteries to the level of the foot on delayed phase imaging. Flow in the left anterior tibial artery can be visualized to the level of the mid tibial diaphysis, though not distally to the foot.  RIGHT: The right common femoral artery is patent with mild atherosclerotic plaque. There is minimal amount of occlusive thrombus in the proximal right deep femoral artery for a short course, though with patent perforating vessels. The right superficial femoral artery demonstrates moderate atherosclerotic plaque, though is patent throughout. However, there is complete occlusion of the right popliteal artery beginning at the level of the patella, though with distal reconstitution just proximal to the bifurcation of the common tibioperoneal trunk and right anterior tibial artery. Distal runoff to the ankle is preserved in the right anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are multilevel degenerative changes of the spine, though no acute fracture or bone destructive lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. Occluded left common femoral artery with extension of thrombus into the left superficial femoral artery to just above the knee. The left popliteal artery is attenuated though patent. Distal runoff in the left posterior tibial and peroneal arteries is preserved to the foot. Flow in the left anterior tibial artery is seen to the level of the mid-diaphysis of the tibia.   2. Occluded right popliteal artery though with distal reconstitution and preserved distal runoff to the level of the ankle.  Brief Hospital Course: Pt presented with cold left foot and underwent LLE angio with L CFA cutdown, thrombectomy L CFA/SFA, and patch angioplasty. On POD#1, pt had elevated Cr at 1.5, so IVF was continued. Low urine output prompted fluid bolus, which improved UO. On POD#3, A-line was discontinued and pt was able to get out of bed. Physical therapy worked with pt to help with mobility. IVF was continued throughout POD#3. Pt was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on POD#4. Pt continuted to experience pain in her L leg and it was explained through an interpretor that this is the normal post-operative course and that the pain will improve with time. INR level will be managed by her PCP, ___.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Acarbose 50 mg PO BID 2. Amiodarone 200 mg PO DAILY 3. GlipiZIDE 2.5 mg PO DAILY 4. Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY 5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY 6. Simvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY 7. Warfarin 2.5 mg PO DAYS (___)

 Discharge Instructions: This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you 

otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency. . ACTIVITY: . No driving until cleared by your Surgeon. . Exercise: . Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. . Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon. . No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days. . BATHING/SHOWERING: . You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. You may have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be done 

by the Surgeon on your ___ appointment. . WOUND CARE: . Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple removal. . When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 

stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower. . Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery. . MEDICATIONS: . Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary. . Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel 

that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the day. CAUTIONS: . NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation. . No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery. . DIET: . There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred. . For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile 

in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that 

most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to 

decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor. . If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight 

management program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor. . If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may 

request a referral from your doctor. ___ APPOINTMENT: . Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood 

pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated! . Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a ___ visit. This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge. Normal office hours are ___ through ___. . PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.  Followup Instructions: ___
