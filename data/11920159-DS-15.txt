IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with history of CAD s/p MI, prior syncope and paroxysmal AF who presented after a syncopal episode associated with the desire to pass urine. The history of diaphoresis, pallor, and syncope suggests a vaso-vagal cause. She had a positive UA and was treated for a UTI. Unfortunately her urine was not sent for culture. CEs were negative and there was no evidence of arrhythmia on telemetry. . # Syncope: With evidence of UTI on her UA, and history, was felt to be vasovagal, micturition-like syncope. The quick recovery and prodrome of light-headedness and sweating without palpitations further supports this. Prior AF episodes have been asymptomatic. Telemetry monitoring showed no arrhythmia, cardiac enzymes were flat. Her CXR was also negative. HCT was stable, and she was not orthostatic. Her BP remained stable in house. Heart murmur not felt to be aortic stenosis clinically though outpatient ECHO was recommended. She was with a 5-day course of Bactrim and discharged on ___.
