Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. Cardiac catheterization ___ 2. Cardiac stenting of left main coronary artery and right coronary artery ___ 3. Tunneled hemodialysis line placement ___  History of Present Illness: Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in ___, sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in ___, s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from ___ in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric ___, and critical left main disease. . Patient was transferred from ___. She had recently been discharged after treatment of pneumonia (unknown antibiotic course), and while at home in days after discharge, developed progressive dyspnea and possible fever.  She denied sputum production or cough. BNP on admission was 1000, up from 600 during previous admission for pneumonia. She was started on Zpack, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation, and given IV lasix 20mg tid for pulmonary edema. She does not take lasix as an outpatient. She was noted to have a Cr of 1.4 on admission, which rose to 4.8 with diuresis. Lasix was discontinued and renal consult was obtained, who recommended stopping lasix, giving IVF for pre-renal azotemia, and changing levofloxacin to ampicillin.  She was also found to have an enterococcus UTI and started on unasyn. ID and heme/onc consultations were obtained for leukocytosis 19 with left shift. Both agreed that leukocytosis was likely reactive, but to treat pneumonia and UTI, and to follow-up with outpatient records. Patient does have chronic leukocytosis and thrombocytosis noted during prior admission to BI as well. Per heme/onc consultation at that time, pattern appeared less likely to be MDS, more likely to be reactive, possibly related to iron deficiency as well. Patient was initiated on HD 4 days prior to transfer, received third run of HD today, during which she developed acute left-sided chest pain, ___, not radiating. She developed severe respiratory distress, was intubated, had then noted to have new inferiorlateral ST depressions on her EKG (I and aVL and V6) then goes to cath lab where they find 90% LM, 70% RCA, but no interventions were performed.  She was transferred to the ___ CCU for further management. .  Unable to obtain ROS as patient is intubated.

The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior free wall, and lateral wall. Contractile function of the posterior wall appears preserved. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. . Renal Ultrasound ___: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. No change from a CT in ___. . CARDIAC CATH ___ COMMENTS:    1. Successful PCI of the ___ with a 3.0x15mm Promus DES, post-dilated to 4.0mm. 2. Successful PCI to the RCA with a 3.0x23mm Promus DES, post-dilated to 3.5mm. 3. Terumo band to the right radial artery. 4. No complications. . FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful PCI to the ___ and RCA with Promus DES. 3. Patient to remain on aspirin and clopidogrel indefinitely, without interruption. 4. No complications. . CT head ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Left occipital lobe loss of gray-white differentiation could be related an acute on chronic infarct. An MR may be obtained for further evaluation. 2. Left maxillary sinus fluid. . MRI head ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Chronic infarction identified in the left parietooccipital region with extensive area of encephalomalacia, associated chronic microvascular ischemic disease is present. 2. Punctate areas of restricted diffusion are noted in the subcortical white matter on the right frontal lobe, left frontal convexity and right prefrontal region, likely consistent with small thromboembolic ischemic changes. 3. There is narrowing of the left internal carotid siphon and distal vascular branches, likely consistent with atherosclerotic disease as described above. 4. Mucosal thickening is noted on the left maxillary sinus with air-fluid levels, possibly consistent with ongoing inflammatory process. . Interventional ___ IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a temporary hemodialysis catheter for a 23 cm tunneled hemodialysis catheter. The catheter tip is in the right atrium. The line is ready to use. . CXR ___: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with atelectasis and small effusion. Less prominent changes are seen on the right. . Carotid Ultrasound ___ Impression: Right ICA 70-79% stenosis. Cannot rule out more severe stenosis due to calcification. Consider CTA if clinically indicated. Left ICA no stenosis.

 Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in ___, sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in ___, s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from OSH in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric ___, and critical left main disease. . Active Diagnoses: # CAD: Cardiac cath showed 90% LM, 70% RCA lesion, no intervention was performed initially. Initial EKG at OSH showed severe STE in I and aVR, ST depressions in lateral leads.  Repeat EKG on transfer looked improved although still with STE in I and aVR. Patient still endorses chest pain when asked.  Patient was initially on a heparin gtt and nitro gtt. CT surgery consultation believed patient was too high risk to take for CABG, due to multiple comorbidities. Thus, patient was taken to cardiac cath and DES were placed in left main and RCA.  She was continued on coreg 3.125 mg bid, captopril 6.25 mg tid, plavix 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily. She is to not stop aspirin or plavix without speaking to her cardiologist. .  # Respiratory Distress. Patient was initially intubated at OSH for respiratory distress, thought to be secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Patient was previously hospitalized a week prior to this current presentation for pneumonia (unclear course), discharged, and repeat CXR on admission looks like worsened pneumonia/CHF. Patient was diuresed at OSH, but developed acute on chronic renal failure. Renal consultation team thought was pre-renal azotemia, so patient was given IVF, and may have redeveloped pulmonary edema. At baseline, patient has severe COPD on 2L oxygen at home. She was transferred intubated, sedated on CMV 400 x 14 50% FiO2. Fentanyl/versed was used for sedation, as patient is allergic to propofol. CVVH was later initiated for volume management. Patient did well with RISB and SBTs, and was extubated once volume removal was achieved with dialysis. She remains on 2L NC on discharge, but oxygenates well on room air to 2L NC. . # Altered Mental Status: As sedation was turned off to prepare patient for extubation, it was noted that she had prolonged AMS and was not able to follow commands and did not have intact gag reflex. CVVH was continued to correct toxic-metabolic disturbances. CT head was obtained that showed question of ischemic injury in watershed zone between left MCA/PCA territories. A MRI brain was obtained that showed no such infarction, but small areas of acute ischemia in the left frontal lobe. Neurology consult was called, and these areas are believed to be too small to be the cause of AMS. Neurology recommended obtaining a carotid duplex for further evaluation of the acute ischemia. Although patient had R ICA stenosis, intervention was felt to be too high risk, and risks would likely outweigh benefits. Her mental status slowly improved and she is near baseline per family on discharge. . # CKD: Patient has solitary kidney, CKD Stage III. On admission to OSH, Cr was 1.4, but with diuresis had bumped to 4.8. Was initially thought to be pre-renal, but after discontinuing lasix and giving IVF, did not show improvement in renal function, so likely ATN. Was initiated on HD at OSH 4 days prior to transfer, had received 3 cycles at OSH. OSH work-up revealed that patient may have renal artery stenosis as evidenced by atrophic kidney (however, this could just be from CKD)and elevated renin and aldosterone. Patient was maintaed on CVVH during this hospitalization. A temporary dialysis catheter was placed, and a tunneled line was then placed. PPD was confirmed negative. She will continue hemodialysis in rehab and outpatient setting. She is discharged on nephrocaps. Epo should be initited with next session of dialysis. Of note, renal recovery is possible for this patient and the need for HD should be continuously reassessed. .  # UTI: Had enterococcus UTI at OSH and received 5 day course of Unasyn prior to transfer. Upon calling OSH for speciation/sensitivity, it was found that enterococcus only sensitive to vancomycin, so patient has finished a 14 day course on ___. .  # Leukocytosis: Patient had leukocytosis at OSH up to 30. ID and heme consults both thought could be reactive, secondary to infectious processes (pneumonia, UTI). Patient is also noted to have chronic leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, as noted in discharge summary in ___. At that time, heme/onc consultation also thought findings were reactive and not associated with hematologic malignancy. Now, WBC 37.7 with 6% bands points to infectious etiology. As patient was treated for infection, leukocytosis trended down to ___. BCR-ABL pcr looking for CML was negative. Hematology/oncology team felt that this could be a smoldering myeloproliferative disease with overlying component of infection. JAK 2 returned positive, and there was a likely presumptive diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis vs other myeloproliferative disorders. .  # Thrombocytosis: Patient has thrombocytosis to the millions.  Although this could be reactive, should assess other possible sources and hematologic disorder. Jak2 mutation looking for myeloproliferative diseases was positive. Platelet count trended down with treatment of infection, indicating a probably reactive etiology as well. Plt count on discharge 540k. . # Vasculopathy: Patient is s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in ___, s/p SMA PCI. She has been chronically anticoagulated on coumadin, but coumadin was held for HD line placement at OSH. Patient was later started on plavix and aspirin this admission and maintained on a heparin gtt. Heparin gtt was discontinued when INR was 2.5. Goal INR ___. . #. Code Status: FULL .
