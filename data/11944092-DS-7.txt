___ Abd/Pelvis U/S Gassy abdomen preventing visualization of the pancreas and retroperitoneum. The upper abdominal study is otherwise unremarkable in this patient who is status post cholecystectomy.   Pelvic ultrasound shows what appears to be at least one polypoid mucosal lesion in the bladder, which is suspicious for possible urothelial neoplasm. This could be evaluated directly with cystoscopy. 

___ CXR A and P Hyperinflation without evidence of acute intrathoracic process. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air. 

___ CT Urogram

FINDINGS:   There is massive distension of the rectum by a very large amount of impacted feces. The rectum measures up to 11 cm in transverse diameter. The impacted stool extends from the rectum into the sigmoid colon to the junction of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon. In craniocaudal distance, this process extends over at least 30 cm. The colon proximal to this is at the upper limits of normal in diameter. The small bowel is not dilated. There is no evidence of intraperitoneal gas. There is no evidence of perforation at this time.   The bladder is displaced anteriorly and to the right by the distended rectum. The bladder is not full at the time of examination. The bladder contains a urinary catheter which had been clamped at time of examination. The urothelium of the bladder demonstrates abnormal increased enhancement, compatible with inflammation. The polypoid lesion demonstrated on ultrasound is not visualized on the current CT. Of note, the tip of the urinary catheter projects past the lumen of the bladder, however, since the bladder is not distended, the tip of the catheter may lie within a redundant fold.   There is a fluid-containing structure anterior to the distended rectum in the midline. The configuration of this structure and its relationship to ovarian vessels is most compatible with a displaced uterus with fluid- containing endometrial cavity. The endometrial cavity measures 13 mm in anteroposterior dimension. This is likely as a result of downstream obstruction due to mass effect by the greatly distended rectum, but reassessment of this following disimpaction is recommended.   There is a small hypodense interpolar right renal lesion measuring 7 mm in diameter, likely representing a simple cyst. No enhancing right renal neoplasm is evident. There is no hydronephrosis on the right.   The left kidney appears normal with no evidence of hydronephrosis.   Both adrenal glands are normal. Subcentimeter para-aortic lymph nodes are demonstrated.   The spleen is normal. The common bile duct is at the upper limits of normal in size measuring 1 cm. No obstructing mass is demonstrated. The pancreas is normal. No focal liver lesion is identified. The portal vein is patent.   There is mild ascites.   Note is made of an area of increased density at the tip of the appendix compatible with an appendicolith. The appendix measures 4 mm in diameter and there is no evidence of appendicitis.   There are two right dynamic hip screws in situ. There is degenerative change in the lumbar spine with upper lumbar levoscoliosis.   IMPRESSION: 1. Very marked distention of the rectum and sigmoid colon by a large amount of impacted feces.   2. Displacement of the bladder anteriorly and to the right by distended rectum with evidence of abnormal increased enhancement of the urothelium suggesting chronic inflammation, possibly due to ongoing stasis due to obstruction by distended rectum.   3. Fluid-containing structure in the midline anterior to the distended rectum likely represents the uterus with hydrometrocolpos. 

___ Abd Supine and Erect Three radiographs of the abdomen demonstrate copious stool in the colon.  There is an air-filled proximal colon and cecum. Several mildly distended air and fluid-filled loops of small bowel are identified on the lateral decubitus view. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. Pins projecting over the right femoral neck are incompletely assessed.   IMPRESSION: Fecal impaction. No pneumoperitoneum identified. 

Culture Data: Urine ___ - >3 colony types c/w fecal contamination Urine ___ - no growth  Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o F with hx chronic constipation, who presented with recent urinary retention, hematuria, and continued constipation requiring disimpaction found to have a polypoid bladder lesion suspicious for malignancy. .  # Constipation: Likely ___ dehydration, longterm decreased mobility, diet, and decrease mobility. In house bowel regimen of colace, senna, miralax with several enemas did not produce BM. Lactulose was held and mag citrate was given once which resulted in many bowel movements and improvement in abdominal distention. She was encouraged to ambulate with assistance, was given gentle IVFs, prune juice and yogurt. This massive constipation was felt to be the cause of the patient's urinary retention. After additional improvement in constipation, the patient should undergo foley removal with voiding trial. The patient was also scheduled with a motility specialist as an outpatient. .  # Hematuria/polypoid bladder lesion on pelvic ultrasound: Suspicious for malignancy. Pt has had recent weight loss and new urinary retention with hematuria. Family aware of pelvic u/s findings, and would like further evaluation for now. Urology was involved and patient was scheduled for outpatient cystoscopy. The patient's hematocrit should be followed up to ensure stability with ongoing hematuria prior to cystoscopy. .  # UTI: Pyuria on admission with culture showing fecal contamination. Repeat ua with culture showed significant pyuria but culture without growth. Patient was given a 7 day course of cipro for complicated UTI. Her SNF was instructed to check urine after completion of cipro course and have results sent to PCP. If culture remains sterile, may be ___ bladder mass. .  # Positive guiaic stool: Positive in ED. Pt has not been in system since ___, unclear if current crit is new baseline. Patient was hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. Later guaiacs were all negative. The patient's Hct remained stable while in the hospital. Upon discharge, her SNF was advised to check Hct for stability and have results sent to PCP for further workup of stable anemia. .  On ___, the patient was stooling frequently with improved abdominal exam. Vitals were stable and she was in good condition. She was therefore discharged with followup plan addresssed.
