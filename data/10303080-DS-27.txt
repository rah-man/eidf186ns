Hospital course was complicated by persistent volume overload and dyspnea requiring initiation of hemodialysis. 

=============== ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== # Acute Decompensated HFpEF Presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and weight gain - last discharge weight: 106.9 kg (235.67lbs) (___).

Unclear etiology for this admission, though suspect fluid overload may be ___ ___ on CKD (Cr 4.4 at admission (___), compared to Cr 2.5 on ___. Trop peaked @0.04 on ___, CKMB 3. BNP: 19051 (13113 at last admission). ___ pMIBI: Fixed medium sized moderate severity perfusion defect. Cath was not performed given ___. Actively diuresed with Bumex gtt, though was discontinued due to diffuse myalgias and instead given Lasix + started HD for volume removal. 

On ___, pt was triggered for dyspnea and hypoxemia, and was sent to the CCU for BiPAP. In the CCU he was continued on a Lasix drip and was continued with daily HD. Lasix drip was discontinued on ___ due to inadequate response. His afterload regimen was titrated to the following: labetalol 600 TID was discontinued and he was started on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily; hydralazine was held; amlodipine 10 mg daily was continued.

# Acute on chronic Anemia # ___ esophagus # Duodenal Mass Hgb 7.0 at admission ___ in past year). Likely mixed with AoCD ___ CKD and iron deficiency based on prior iron studies. ___ EGD notable for multiple gastric polyps (2-5mm) in fundus and body of stomach and ___ + bleeding 4cm duodenal adenoma. s/p EGD ___ with removal of duodenal adenoma. s/p 1U pRBC on ___ for Hgb 6.8, 1U pRBC on ___. GI followed closely given concern for reported melena 48 hours after EGD/duodenal adenoma removal and low Hgb ~7. Hep gtt (for Afib) was briefly paused for 24 hours after EGD due to concern for ongoing bleeding, but was restarted given stable H/H and hemodynamic stability. Otherwise, continued on Protonix bid, and received ferrlecit 125mg x 8 doses (per Renal - ___. On arrival to the CCU patient's hemoglobin was noted to be downtrending in the setting of melanic stool. He remained hemodynamically stable but required 2 transfusion (___). His heparin drip (started for Afib) was held and repeat EGD was performed on ___ which showed clot at site where adenoma was removed, no active bleeding. Epi was injected and clips were placed. Patient's hemoglobin stabilized and he had no further episodes of melena.

# pAF (CHADS2VASC 6). Diagnosed at last admission (___) and spontaneously converted to NSR. Started Eliquis 5mg bid at last admission; however, this was c/b GI bleed (melena).

Hep gtt was briefly held due to concern for ongoing GI bleeding, then restarted, but held again when he developed further transfusion requirements in the CCU as described above. Once patient's hemoglobin stabilized, he was started on warfarin without a bridge due to recent GI bleeding. For rate control, he was transitioned from home labetalol 600mg tid to metoprolol succinate 50mg daily.

# Hypertension Initaially continued home labetalol 600 mg TID, amlodipine 10 mg daily, hydralazine to 50 mg TID. In the CCU labetalol was discontinued and hydralazine held due to low blood pressures. In place of labetalol he was started on metoprolol as above.

Given persistent volume overload/dyspnea despite aggressive diuresis, HD was initiated on ___. PPD was placed/read (no induration) and hepatitis serologies were obtained; Hep B booster was administered. Discharged on Sevelamer 800mg TID.

He underwent R thoracentesis on ___ and L thoracentesis on ___ after which he no long had a supplemental oxygen requirement. He will follow up with interventional pulmonology to monitor for re-accumulation.

# Urinary retention Started Flomax 0.4mg qhs

=============== RESOLVED ISSUES: =============== # Diffuse joint pain Reported diffuse joint pain shortly after starting Bumex gtt which was subsequently stopped in favor of Lasix gtt due to his pain. Resolved off Bumex. 

# Diarrhea At admission, reported ___ per day for the past few days prior to admission. Resolved. 

=============== CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # Left diabetic medial plantar foot ulcer Left foot has ~1.5cm ulcer on medial plantar surface of left foot. Followed by outpatient Podiatry. Seen by Inpatient Wound Care who agreed with outpatient Wound Care ___ recs (___): NSW to left foot wound, pat dry and apply Aquacel AG to wound bed and covered by 3x3 silicone bordered foam 3 x weekly. Apply removable felted foam. Dressing changes every other day.

# Gout Continued allopurinol ___ qod

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - EGD pathology (___) showing low grade dysplasia with focal high-grade dysplasia, recommend repeat EGD in 6 months for surveillance. - continue hepatitis B vaccination series (s/p first dose ___ - consider cMRI to further evaluate possible AR - 10 cm intramuscular lipoma in the right posterior chest wall. Given its size, a dedicated MRI could be considered. - IP follow up / further management of large pleural effusion / chest tube - follow up pleural fluid cytology results - Blood sugars remained above goal prior to discharge.
