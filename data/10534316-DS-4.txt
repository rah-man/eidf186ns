 Name: ___        Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: PSYCHIATRY  Allergies: Bactrim / cephalexin  Attending: ___  Chief Complaint: Depression  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ECT  History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of severe agitated psychotic depression and suicide attempt, s/p two unsuccessful ECT trials in the past, who is transferred to ___ from ___ for possible ECT after a recent suicide attempt via overdose resulting in unresponsiveness and ICU stay. . He was brought in to the ___ on ___ after being found unresponsive by family members earlier that day. He had last been seen in his usual state of health the prior evening. When family found him, he was apparently pulseless, so they initiated CPR and called EMS. When EMS arrived he was significantly hypotensive. He was intubated in the field, and received Narcan in the field without effect. BP on arrival to the ED was 54/35. Diagnostic studies performed included CT head and chest (both unremarkable), EKG and troponins (normal), and elevated CK thought secondary to rhabdomyolysis. His UTox was positive for benzodiazepines and tricyclics, but per admission note "he does take klonopin as well as trazodone" at home. I spoke with the MD who discharged him ___, phone # ___ who reports that they believe it was a benzodiazepine overdose. Patient himself has no recollection of what pills he took. He was admitted to the ICU and then the medical floor for 10 days before he could be stabilized and transferred to Psychiatry. On initial psychiatric interview, he was still encephalopathic but this cleared and MMS improved to ___. He stated that he took many pills on the date of his admission and the intent was to end his life. He fixated on constipation-related pain and asked for enema. . Collateral obtained from his brother ___ at ___ revealed that patient had hospital stays at ___ ___ ECT in the past, but neither were helpful. Over the past several months, patient endorses a 40 pound weight loss (possibly due to poor eating but he is unsure) from 170 to 130 lbs. He reports trying to take Ensure while at ___ but still could not gain weight. Patient also has a fixation with enemas and has several of them in his apartment. He is apparently convinced that there is always something wrong with him. Per his brother ___, the patient also apparently often thinks that he smells and that this is affecting other people. Mr. ___ tells us today that both of his past suicide attempts were due to frustration with his bowel problems: this last attempt was prompted by receiving an enema at an ED but being unable to figure out how to use it, so he decided to end his life. . Hospital course at ___: When he arrived on Psychiatry unit he admitted to ___ but had no plan; was upset that his attempt had failed. He reported insomnia and weight loss, but was observed to sleep well overnight and eat most of his meals. He was started on Risperdal, Effexor and Remeron and uptitrated on all of these in the setting of ongoing psychotic depression, irritability and self-isolation. He complained of insomnia, so was started on Trazodone which was uptitrated. During stay he continued to fixate on his bowel movements in a psychotic manner, convinced he was constipated despite frequent formed stools. When asked why he had attempted suicide, he stated that he was frustrated by his abnormal bowel function. Over time he started to deny that he'd had any suicidal thoughts. Other times he seemed more anxious and paranoid, and refused to come out to the dining room for a meal. Per the discharge summary, "Psychologically, the patient was quite nihilistic in his attitude; he was also noted to be somewhat dependent on others and avoidant as well". . Ultimately, with the patient's reluctant consent it was decided to transfer him to ___ for another trial of ECT.

CHEST CT W/O CONTRAST ___, ___ Report): There is hypoventilatory change/atalectasis within the posterior aspects of the lower lobes. Additionally there is consolidative opacity with air bronchograms identified along the posterior lateral left lung base extending to the periphery. This may represent atalectasis through pneumonia including aspiration etiology cannot be excluded. Partially imaged is cholelithiasis. 

PA/LAT CXR (___): PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.There is a normal heart size, and overall normal mediastinal contour is demonstrated. There is substantial elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, reason unclear. There is adjacent opacity at least in part representing right middle lobe atelectasis. Although no definitive right hilar mass is demonstrated, it cannot be entirely excluded and correlation with chest CT would be recommended on a non-emergency basis. The appearance of the thoracic spine is unremarkable within the limitations of the study technique.

___ X-RAY SUPINE/UPRIGHT (___): There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, also seen on the chest radiograph from the same day. The lung bases appear clear. Nonspecific non-dilated loops of small bowel are present. There is a moderate amount of colonic stool. There is no pneumoperitoneum.

EKG (___): Sinus rhythm. Borderline low voltage in the limb leads. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CT CHEST W CONTRAST (___): 1. Filling defects in the right main pulmonary artery extending into the upper and lower lobar pulmonary arteries consistent with nonocclusive pulmonary emboli. No CT evidence of right heart strain. 2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with associated right lower lobe atelectasis/scarring and bronchiectasis 3. Collapse of the right middle lobe; as the right middle lobe is collapsed it is difficult to evaluate for an underlying mass, but airways are open and none is detected. 4. Mild emphysema

VIDEO SWALLOW EVAL (___): Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There was 1 episode of trace penetration with thin liquids but no aspiration. IMPRESSION: There was a trace penetration with thin liquids but no aspiration.

PA/LAT CXR (___): As compared to the previous image, the pre-existing elevation of the right hemidiaphragm has slightly increased. In addition, a pre-existing atelectasis at the right lung base is also more extensive than seen on the previous image. There is no evidence of pleural effusion on both the frontal and the lateral radiograph. Both the atelectasis and the elevation of the hemidiaphragm could be related to the known episode of pulmonary embolism. The remaining lung is unremarkable. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.

CT ___ (___): There is no evidence of malignancy.  Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ year old single man, history of depression with psychotic features, recent suicide attempt, s/p failed ECT trials who presents as a transfer from ___ for possible ECT treatment s/p recent suicide attempt via overdose resulting in ICU admission. Patient's history significant for approximately ___ year h/o affective unipolar mood disorder with psychosis characterized by intense somatic preoccupation, social withdrawal, significant weight loss and two suicide attempts the patient could not clearly describe but that seem to be related to his somatic preoccupation. Differential diagnosis is somewhat broad, but etiology seems most likely secondary to a psychotic depression.

PSYCHIATRIC: #. Legal/Safety: patient admitted on ___, CV signed and accepted. Patient maintained safety throughout admission on 15 minute checks

#. Depression: as above with psychotic features - Medicine and anesthesia consulted and cleared the patient for ECT. Received a total of 14 treatments (9 bilateral), which were converted to bilateral ECT starting with treatment #5. - Remeron was increased to 22.5 mg po qhs on ___. He tolerated this increase well without significant side effects. - Risperidone was increased to 1 mg po bid on ___. He tolerated this increase well without significant side effects.  - Venlafaxine was continued at 75 mg po bid with meals. - Trazodone was continued at 150 mg po qhs +25 mg po prn insomnia - Around the time that his ECT was increased to bilateral treatments, he began to show evidence of significant mood improvement. On admission he had intense somatic preoccupation with his bowel movements, characterized by feelings of depression on days when he was constipated and a rigid inflexibility wherein he felt he could not contract for safety or guarantee that he would not attempt suicide in the future if his constipation persisted. About halfway through hospitalization, he became more flexible and less preoccupied around this somatic complaint. He began to also show greater range of affect and less anhedonia. By discharge, he was significantly less somatically preoccupied with his bowels, endorsed an improved mood without suicidal thoughts, and was future oriented. - Discharge diagnosis was depression with psychotic features. Psychosis secondary to cognitive decline was felt unlikely due to his normal performance on MOCA (___), unremarkable full neurologic exam, and general high level of function on ADLs at baseline. 

MEDICAL: #. PE: on ___ patient underwent spiral CT to follow-up on CXR/CT that showed ?atelectasis. Radiology report revealed incidental finding of multiple PE's including a large right main pulmonary artery embolus. Medicine and Pulmonology services were consulted. Per Pulm recs, the patient was started on anticoagulation with Rivaroxiban 20mg daily, then switched to Lovenox (weight-based protocol) BID while receiving ECT -- chosen for its reversible properties. On completion of ECT, he was switched back to Rivaroxiban (dose 20mg daily). Will need to complete at least 3 month course of anticoagulation. He will follow up with Pulm as outpatient ___ weeks following initial diagnosis (date of follow up ___ and will need repeat chest CT with contrast on that date. Of note there is concern for possible lung mass underlying the significant atalectasis seen on CT, which will be investigated on the repeat chest CT. Given patient's smoking history and unintentional 40 pound weight loss over the past ___ years, cancer is of particular concern. Video swallow was negative for aspirtation. For full neoplastic workup, CT abdomen was also performed in hospital, showing no evidence of neoplasm. 

#. COPD: stable during this admission - Continued patient's home Advair 250/50 1 puff bid. This was increased to 500/50 with improvement in symptoms. - Added Duonebs inh q6hrs PRN, with additional doses given on ECT days 

#. HTN: stable during this admission - continued home lisinopril 

#. Bowel issues: likely related to depression - Continued home stool softeners and added Metamucil wafers. - Reported improved symptoms with ECT.

CONTACTS: Psychiatrist = ___ (phone ___ PCP = ___ (phone # ___ Brother (HCP) = ___ (work # ___, cell # ___ Sister in law = ___ (phone # ___ Pharmacy = ___ (phone # ___ 

Risk Assessment: Patient is at elevated chronic risk for suicide given chronic severe depression, chronic medical illness, hx of suicide attempts, and demographics. His risk was modified during hospialization with ECT and medication changes with improvement in depressive symptoms and resolution of suicidality, supportive psychotherapy, and with procurement of outpatient treaters.  Protective factors include a supportive family, future orientation, and absence of current suicidality. At this point in time with the available evidence, patient is not at imminent risk of harm to self and can be discharged with outpatient followup.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the ___ inpatient psychiatry unit for worsening depression and several recent suicide attempts. We made some changes to your medications and treated you with ECT (electro-convulsive therapy). While in the hospital you were found to have a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) which was treated with blood thinning medications. Your depression improved significantly in the hospital. You will need to follow up closely with Psychiatry, your Primary Care doctor, and Pulmonology (lung specialists) after discharge. See below for appointment information.  Followup Instructions: ___
