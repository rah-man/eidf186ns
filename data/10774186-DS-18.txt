 Name: ___           Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending: ___  Chief Complaint: Possible chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo woman with H/O of atrial flutter/fibrillation (not on anticoagulation), severe mitral regurgitation now S/P porcine MVR, pulmonary hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, polycythemia ___, severe dementia and hypothyroidism who presents with ST elevations on EKG. 

Patient reportedly experienced 2 unwitnessed falls with headstrike at her rehabilitation facility and was brought to ___. To most examining physicians, she did not endorse any symptoms of chest pain or palpitations (although she subsequently told another physician that she had experienced severe chest pain that had since resolved). Per her HCP, patient has been having worsening dementia for several years and has repeatedly voiced her desire to die. She was found to have TnT 0.32 (per report, unable to locate lab report in chart) and EKG showing inferior STEMI. Head and neck CT were negative. She was then transferred to the ___. In the ___ initial VS T 97.6 P 72 BP 145/74 RR 16 O2 Sat 97% on RA. Labs were remarkable for TnT 0.32, WBC 11.4, HCO3 21, AG 17, UA with RBCs. EKG showed atrial flutter with ventricular rate 81 bpm with 1 mm STE in III, ?II, and avF. CXR showed old hilar calcification, prominent interstitial markings and a hilar opacity for which infection was in the differential diagnoses. Cardiology was consulted and, after discussion with patient's HCP, it was felt that, in light of goals of care and the patient's likely inability to cooperate during an invasive procedure, coronary angiography and intervention was deferred in favor of medical management. She received ASA 325 mg PO x 1 and was started on a heparin drip. On the floor, patient reported diffuse abdominal pain, which she states has been present for several weeks. She reports chronic shortness of breath. She did not endorse chest pain at the time of admission to Cardiology. She is A+O to self, "mental hospital", "___" and "Obama". She is unable to describe the reason for her hospitalization. Several hours after arrival, patient was found on floor sitting and leaning against bed by PCA (per nursing report, several seconds after bed alarm rang). 

 ROS: On review of systems, patient denies H/O DVT, pulmonary embolus, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. (Note the patient does have dementia.)

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECG ___ 8:43:22 ___ Possible atrial flutter with variable block. See the flutter waves in lead V1. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ atrial flutter is present.

CXR ___: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Calcified mediastinal and hilar nodes are again noted. There is increased prominence of the interstitial markings concerning for pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. Right infrahilar opacity along the right heart border is slightly more prominent as compared to the prior study and could be due to consolidation from infection or atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.

CXR ___: There are lower lung volumes. There are increasing opacities in the lower lobes consistent with increasing atelectasis. Small bilateral effusions are more conspicuous than before. There is no evident pneumothorax. Mild interstitial edema has increased. Multiple calcified lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hila are again noted. Sternal wires are aligned.  IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema. Of note, evaluation of rib fractures is very limited due to technique and patient body habitus. If clinical persistent concern, dedicated rib series are recommended.

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Consider prior inferior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ sinus rhythm has appeared. There is variation in precordial lead placement and apparent more prominent lateral T wave changes. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Hip/pelvis X-ray ___:   In comparison with the outside study of ___, there is little overall change. No definite evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. However, if there is serious clinical concern for an occult fracture, cross-sectional imaging could be obtained.  There are mild degenerative changes symmetrically involving the hip joints, essentially within normal limits for patient age. Severe degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar spine.  KUB ___: Supine radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate normal bowel gas pattern. There is no evidence of intraperitoneal free air on limited supine view. There is interval improvement in bibasilar opacities, with residual pulmonary edema at the bases versus possibly underlying interstitial lung disease. Lower median sternotomy wires are noted. IMPRESSION: Normal bowel gas pattern without evidence of ileus or obstruction.

CXR ___: Compared to the prior study there is improved aeration bilaterally but there continues to be patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate and increased interstitial markings and ___ B-lines with a small left effusion. IMPRESSION: Improvement in CHF.  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo woman with H/O of atrial flutter/fibrillation (not on anticoagulation), severe mitral regurgitation now S/P bovine MVR, pulmonary hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, polycythemia ___, severe dementia and hypothyroidism who presents with a STEMI. 

# STEMI: Patient presented in transfer to the ED with evidence of inferior STEMI with elevated troponin, ECG changes, chronic abdominal pain and inconsistent self-reports regarding chest pain (mostly reporting no chest pain, but told one examiner that she had experienced severe chest pain). In addition, her unwitnessed falls might have represented an ischemia-related ventricular arrhythmia. Given discussion regarding goals of care and concerns about patient's ability to cooperate with an invasive procedure, she was treated medically with heparin for 48 hrs, aspirin, clopidogrel, high dose statin and metoprolol. The peak TnT was 0.32 early after presentation (? more subacute presentation) with normal CKMB. She did not report any chest pain during her admission. Echocardiographic evaluation of infarct size and LV systolic function was not obtained due to patient's inability to cooperate with even this non-invasive examination. Due to patient's H/O multiple recent falls, we decided to discontinue clopidogrel on ___ (as the risk of major bleeding on ASA+clopidogrel is no better than the risk on warfarin alone, and she was already deemed not a candidate for oral anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation). Patient developed some shortness of breath and hypoxemia on HD1. Chest plain film showed some pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with acute diastolic heart failure. She was given furosemide 10 mg IV and her respiratory status improved. She was discharged on ASA, metoprolol succinate, atorvastatin and losartan. 

# Atrial fibrillation/flutter - CHADS of 5. Discussed anticoagulation with patient's PCP and HCP and confirmed that she was high risk for fall and anticoagulation was contrary to her goals of care. Patient was rate controlled with metoprolol, and her diltiazem was stopped. She was continued on home ASA after short inpatient courses of heparin and clopidogrel.

# Major Depression/Severe Dementia: Patient expressed some passive suicidal ideation during her hospitalization. She was placed on 1:1 sitter precautions and did not try to injure herself. She did not report a plan and was evaluated by the psychiatric nurse and determined not to be threat to her self. She denied suicidal ideation by time of discharge. She was continued on home mirtazapine and rivastigmine. At times, the patient refused her pills, especially in the evening. Her medications were changed to once daily preparations dosed in the morning.

# Polycythemia ___ thrombocytosis - Patient's platelet counts rose to 848 on day of discharge. Her hydroxyurea was restarted during hospitalization (500 mg PO 3x/week) given concern for recurrent acute coronary syndrome in the setting of thrombocytosis.

# S/P Fall: During hospitalization, patient slid out of her geriatric chair (witnessed, no trauma). After getting back in the chair, patient complained of some bilateral hip pain. Plain films were performed that did not show any trauma. As her symptoms improved, CT scanning was not pursued. 

# Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine 50 mcg daily. TSH was checked and within normal limits.

# Hematuria: Patient had one episode of hematuria in the setting of aspirin and clopidogrel use. The clopidogrel was discontinued and the hematuria resolved. Follow up UA showed small blood and no evidence of UTI.

CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI Health Care Proxy: ___ # ___

___ issues  - Patient should have CBC checked in one week to make sure that platelets improving on hydroxyurea.
