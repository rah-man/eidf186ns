 Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ ___. During your hospitalization, you had surgery to remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity. You tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.  Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS ACTIVITY You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight whenever possible. This will prevent swelling of the stump and maintain flexibility in your joint.  It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal properly. You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if applicable. It will take time to learn to use a walker and learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair. 

MEDICATION Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all the medicine you should take at home. If a medication that you normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not take is on the list please discuss it with the team! 

You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on discharge which can be very constipating. If you take narcotics, please also take a stool softener such as Colace.  If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest an additional over the counter laxative. 

You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for pain. If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic pain medication. You should require less pain medication each day. Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter and prescription medications. Be aware of how much Tylenol you are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the incision is fully healed. After your shower, gently dry the incision well.  Do not rub the area. 

WOUND CARE: Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that there is no pressure on the stump.  If there is no drainage, you may leave the incision open to air.  Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks. At your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has healed enough to remove the staples. Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be fully healed. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___ Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision 

Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump. Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening incisional/stump pain
