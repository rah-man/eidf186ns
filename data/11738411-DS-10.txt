 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Zestril / Vasotec / Effexor  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Uretheral Stricture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CYSTOSCOPY COLD KNIFE URETHROTOMY (CKU)

 History of Present Illness: ___ year old Mr. ___ is is having some difficulties with his proximal stricture getting the 14 ___ catheter to go in. He is soon to go on a four week boat trip through ___ and is concerned that he could run into difficulties. He is going to continue with the 14. Cystoscopy was performed that did demonstrate a proximal urethral stricture. I was able to navigate a 14 ___ catheter. If he is not able to regularly get the 14 in, he will come into the office, we will dilate him up to 18 or 20 ___, leave an 18 catheter for a week and then have him start to recath with a larger catheter which would give him the option of fall back plans of smaller catheters while he is on his trip.  Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease. This is stable and he is asymptomatic. 2. Hyperlipidemia. His LDL cholesterol is not optimal at 120. We could consider switching him to atorvastatin. I have left his medications unchanged for now. 3. Dizziness. He is going to be getting an ENT evaluation in the near future. We will see him again in the near future. 4. Systolic murmur. First time I have heard a systolic murmur in him. We are going to do an echocardiogram to evaluate this. 

PROBLEM LIST: 1. Dizziness. I think this is ultimately going to be proved to be in the orthostatic hypotension category. We will see what the vestibular testing shows and if it suggests any more focused vestibular-based treatment. If not and Gene is still symptomatic despite the compression stockings and good hydration, will consult Dr. ___ to see if there is anything else to add. He may be a candidate for midodrine. ___ will call me if he would like to pursue this. 2. Cardiac. As above. Other than the lightheadedness/syncopal episodes, no new cardiac symptoms. 3. Depression, doing well on sertraline. 4. Emphysema, stable.
