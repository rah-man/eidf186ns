 Pertinent Results: Conclusions  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and apex; the rest of the left ventricle is hyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.   Electronically signed by ___, MD, Interpreting physician ___ ___ 09:29 

CT OF THE ABDOMEN : Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are noted at the lung bases. There are severe atelectatic changes of the left lower lobe and part of right lower lobe and right middle lobe. Coronary artery calcification and aortic calcification are also noted. The heart size is moderately enlarged.   The liver is normal. The gallbladder is not visualized. The spleen is enlarged. The spleen contains a wedge-shaped peripheral hypodense area, which based on its shape might represent splenic infarction. Without IV contrast, this appearance is highly nonspecific. The left kidney contains simple cysts within its mid pole measuring approximately 2.3 and 3.8 cm. The right kidney contains a 5-mm hyperdense cyst and 3mm of calcification which might represent stone or calcified artery. The adrenal glands have normal appearance. The pancreas, common bile duct, stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel and large bowel are normal. Small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvis.   CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum and sigmoid colon have normal appearance. Urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and the prostate gland is mildly enlarged. No free air is noted within the abdomen and pelvis. No 

pathologically enlarged nodes are visualized. Diffuse soft tissue fluid accumulation is compatible with anasarca.   BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.   IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate bibasilar pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectatic changes at the lung bases.   2. Splenomegaly. Wedge-shaped hypodense lesion of the superior pole of the spleen most likely represents an infarct based on morphology. However, without IV contrast, further characterization is not possible and this appearance is highly nonspecific. If indicated, consider repeat study with IV contrast. 3. Small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvis.   4. Two simple cysts are noted in the mid pole and lower pole of the left kidney.   5. Anasarca. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
