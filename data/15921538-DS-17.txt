IMAGING/DIAGNOSTIC TESTS: CTV CT VENOGRAM:   There is approximately 4.5 x 4.8 x 4.3 cm enhancing mass in the right hemipelvis compressing the proximal right external iliac vein just distal to the iliac bifurcation (series 4, image 98; series 6, image 49).  There is a filling defect in the right external iliac vein distal to the mass that extends into the right common femoral vein and further into the superficial and deep femoral veins. There is wall thickening, wall hyperemia, and extensive adjacent fat stranding associated with these veins, suggesting acute/subacute thrombosis. Also noted is extensive edema in the right lower extremity from venous outflow obstruction. Arterial flow to the right lower extremity is preserved. Proximal to the mass the common iliac vein is patent. The inferior vena cava and the left common femoral vein and its major branches are patent.   LOWER CHEST: Partially imaged lung bases are clear. No pleural effusion.   ABDOMEN:   HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout.  There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.   PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.   SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Accessory spleens are noted.   ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.   URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram.  Millimetric hypodensities in the right kidney are too small to characterize but statistically likely represent cysts. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  The right ureter is displaced medially by the pelvic mass however there is no evidence of hydroureter or hydronephrosis to suggest obstruction.   GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia. The stomach is mildly distended with ingested material. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is mild colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The appendix is normal.   PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: There is a mass in the right hemipelvis adjacent to the external iliac artery and vein as described above. The exact origin of the mass remains unclear. The uterus is grossly unremarkable. The ovaries are not discretely visualized.   LYMPH NODES: A few prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm (Series 4, image 68). Aside from the large right pelvic mass there is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. A borderline enlarged anterior right thigh lymph measuring 10 x 13 mm may be reactive. 

  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.   BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  Degenerative changes in the spine are noted.   SOFT TISSUES: There is a small fat containing umbilical hernia.   IMPRESSION:    1. 4.5 x 4.8 x 4.3 cm solid mass in the right hemipelvis, of unclear origin. 2. The mass compresses the right external iliac vein with thrombosis of the distal portion of the right external iliac vein extending into the common femoral and visualized portions of the superficial and deep femoral veins.  The right external iliac vein proximal to the mass, left external iliac vein, and inferior vena cava are patent. 3. Venous outflow obstruction results in extensive edema in the right lower extremity. 4. Moderate size hiatal hernia. 

Pelvis U/S IMPRESSION:   5 cm solid right pelvic mass with internal vascularity is of uncertain etiology. This is more superior than would be expected of a primary ovarian lesion, although an ovarian lesion cannot be entirely excluded.  Neither normal ovary is visualized.   DISCHARGE LABS:
