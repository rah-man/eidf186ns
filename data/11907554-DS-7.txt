 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of reactive airway disease, alcoholic cirrhosis with multiple hospitalizations in the past 6 months for PNA with an empyema in ___ that required a chest tube p/w dyspnea and cough likely ___ reactive airway disease exacerbation/bronchitis in the setting of possible aspiration events leading to pneumonitis/inflammation in the lungs (process is more right-predominant), improved inpatient on steroids along with azithromycin and breathing treatments.  # SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Due to COPD/asthma. CXR with aspiration and possible superimposed PNA however given no clinical evidence of PNA, she was not treated for PNA. She improved on abx/steroids for COPD. Legionella urine negative. Respiratory sputum sample oral flora, no culture done. Treated with prednisone x 5 days, azithromycin x 5 days, fluticasone/salmeterol, albuterol and ipatropium nebs Q6H and prn albuterol. Lasix not robustly efficacious. On aspiration precautions; patient refuses nectar-thickened liquids.

No SBP history, no ascites, no high ___, no grade 2 varices/no varices at all just erosive esophagitis, gastritis. Slight LFT elevation normalized in house. Held spironolactone. Continued nadolol (but given reactive airway disease may be advisable to discontinue the medication if not receiving benefit from hepatology point of view). Counseled on importance of reduced alcohol intake. Na limit to ___ g, fluid restrict to ___ mL, heart-healthy choices.

# HTN: Well controlled HTN. Held spironolactone. Only on nadolol 80 mg PO QD (which is more for her cirrhosis) along with amlodipine 5 mg PO QD.
