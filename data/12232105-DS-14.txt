 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is an ___ female with a history of critical aortic stenosis, systolic congestive heart failure, and deconditioning due to arthritis, who presented to ___ on ___ with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. At the time of presentation she was unable to walk more than 10 feet without dyspnea. These symptoms were suspected to be due a CHF exacerbation from her critical AS. This was her second CHF exacerbation with the first being in ___ when she was first diagnosed with AS. She has never had angina or syncope however she has had lower energy level for at least a year that she was not able to explain. At the OSH she was diuresed with IV Lasix.  She was transferred to ___ for cath and further evaluation of her severe AF. Of note, she was also complaining of URI symptoms which resolved during that admission, except for persistent cough. She did not have any fevers or chills. Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of operative candidacy for aortic valve replacement.

DISCHARGE LABS ==============

IMAGING ============== Prelim Cath Report ___: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated insignificant coronary artery disease. The LMCA was free of flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD had a 50% mid-to-distal stenosis; there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the diagonal branch. The LCx was free of flow-limiting stenoses. The large dominant RCA had a ___ stenosis in the proximal portion of the vessel. 2) Supravalvular aortography demonstrated 1+ aortic regurgitation. The sinus of Valsalva width was 25-27mm in diameter. 3) Distal abdominal aortography demonstrated patency of the left iliac artery (diameter >7mm) and an accordion effect of the right iliac artery, due to vessel tortuosity. 4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures, with a mean wedge pressure of 35 mmHg, and marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA systolic pressure of 75 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg. These findings are consistent with aortic stenosis. There was also marked systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 188/80 mmHg. 5) Estimated cardiac index by ___ principle was normal at 2.4-2.6 l/min/m2. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Critical aortic stenosis with markedly-elevated wedge pressure. 2. Insignificant coronary artery disease. 3. Evaluate for aortic valve replacement surgery. In the meantime, would recommend diuresis and volume status optimization. . CT chest w/o contrast ___: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate. Left lower lobe consolidation that potentially may represent atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Neoplasm is substantially less likely, but follow-up in 8 weeks or comparison with prior studies is recommended. 2. Retrosternal component of large thyroid goiter, approximately 7 cm below the thoracic inlet. 3. Extensive coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications. 4. Compression fracture of lower thoracic vertebral body, most likely T11. . Carotid Doppler ___: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis. . Panorex ___: Technically limited film. Questionable slight resorption of bone 

surrounding the radix of ___. No other evidence of periradicular granulomas .

___ Intra-op TEE Conclusions  There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta and complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace paravalvular leak is seen. There is trace aortic regurgitation. There is echodense material around the aortic bioprosthesis however without blood flow into the echodense space consistent with normal postoperative changes. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal bioprosthetic valve function. Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with borderline left ventricular hypokinesis. Basal to mid septal hypokinesis. Mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.

In comparison to the post-AVR intra-operative TEE from earlier today, the findings are similar. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results.   Electronically signed by ___, MD, Interpreting physician ___ ___ 12:07 

 Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE COURSE:

___ female who has critical aortic stenosis who presented to OSH with CHF exacerbation and was transferred to ___ for management of her AS .  ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure due to Critical Aortic Stenosis: - Will undergo AVR on ___ - Patient improving with diuresis down to 89.4kg (197 lbs) from 213lbs on presentation to OSH. Transitioned to PO lasix 40mg daily - continued home dose of metoprolol   . # Cough/Wheeze: PFTs consistent with obstructive pattern. Possibly related to CHF (cardiac asthma). Patient has no history of asthma or COPD and only minimal smoking history. ABG on room air showed metabolic alkalosis (likely contraction alkalosis from diuresis). No evidence of chronic C02 retention. - Treatment of CHF as above. .  CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # CKD: Creatinine at baseline (1.1-1.3 per report) . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Patient will need 8 week chest xray to evaluate left lower lobe consolidation seen on CT chest ___  - Patient should follow-up with endodontist after discharge from rehab to evaluate ___ tooth. - EMERGENCY CONTACT: Husband ___ (___) ___. ___ ___ (daughter) ___. - For cough. PCP should consider further workup including possibly repeat PFTs if patient with persistent cough after improvement in cardiac function. 

SURGICAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where the patient underwent Aortic Valve Replacement (# 21-mm ___ ___ Ease aortic valve bioprosthesis (model number ___, serial number ___. Aortic Endarterectomy Aortic patch closure with bovine pericardium.(Pericardium data -- reference number ___, lot number ___ Dr. ___. Please refer to operative report for further surgical details.  She left the Operating Room on titrated Levophed and Propofol drips. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. She underwent bronchoscopy for Right Upper Lobe collapse, mucous plug was removed and lobe re-expanded. She was transfused two units of blood for a hematocrit of 28%. The patient was extubated on POD 1. She was alert and slightly confused. Hemodynamics stabilized and she was weaned from vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol. She remained in the CVICU for close monitoring of her renal function. Her Creatnine peaked at 2.4 was trending back down by POD# 5 when she was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD# 8 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged to ___ ___ in ___ in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
