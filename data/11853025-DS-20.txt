IMAGING/STUDIES:

EGD ___ Impression: Erythema and granularity in the antrum Mass in the duodenal bulb with active oozing. Given the uncertainty regarding tissue type on prior biopsies, a small additional biopsy was taken of the mass Epinephrine was injected locally to help temporize bleeding.  However, endoscopic management of bleeding malignancy is generally not definitive because of the vascular/oozing surface of the mass. Cautery and clipping are unlikely to be effective. 

Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  Upper intestinal biopsy pathology ___: report pending

___ embolization procedure ___: 1. Small branches arising from the gastroduodenal artery supplying the duodenal tumor.  2. Complete stasis in the gastroduodenal artery following embolization. 3. Questionable blood supply from an inferior pancreaticoduodenal branch arising off the proximal SMA. IMPRESSION: Embolization of the GDA supplying the duodenal mass. If bleeding continues, further selective embolization can be carried out in the proximal branches of the SMA.

KUB ___: IMPRESSION: Unremarkable bowel gas pattern. No evidence of perforation or intraperitoneal free air.   Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o male with recent diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with unknown primary presented with several days of melena ___ bleeding duodenal mass, s/p unsuccessful endoscopic control, with subsequent successful ___ embolization of gastroduodenal artery

# GIB: Pt presented with melena and low hct. Had EGD ___ which showed a bleeding duodenal mass ___ portion), bx was taken for tissue analysis. Additionally, epi was injected in attempts to stem the bleeding but was unsuccessful. He underwent ___ embolizatin of GDA ___ without further episodes of melena. Pt had some expected post-procedure abdominal pain without signs of ischemia or perforation and this was improving at discharge. Hct uptrending at time of discharge as well. 

# Unknown Malignancy: Pt s/p biopsies of liver mass and peritoneal implant showing undifferentiated cancer (stains negative for all epithelial, lymphoid, endothelial and melanoma or neuroendocrine markers). Pathology from duodenal mass pending. Per onc they are planning to start chemo, however are holding off for now given acute illness. Per surg-onc, they do not want to do any surigcal interventions at this time. The patient should follow up with medical and surgical oncology as an outpatient. 

# Coagulopathy: pt with high INR on admission of 2.4, decreased with FFP and vitamin K. Likely due to liver dysfunction from metastatic cancer vs. poor nutrition. Should be monitored as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Renal failure: pt with creatinine at baseline (around 1.7) during hospitalization. 

# Atrial Fibrillation: Remained in sinus rhythm and normal rate during admission. Held his apixaban during admission due to GIB. Was not restarted at discharge. The patient should follow up with his PCP for further management. 

# CAD s/p stent ___: Initially anticoagulation was held due to GIB; at discharge his aspirin was restarted, along with his carvedilol.  # CHF with ICD in place (EF was ___ per pt report): Held antihypertensives and diuretics during admission due to GIB. Carvedilol and bumex were restarted at discharge. He should follow up with his PCP for for further management. 

# DM: Held home oral diabetes medications while admitted, was managed with sliding scale insulin. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Held the patient's anticoagulation at discharge. He should f/u with his PCP for further management - Patient's blood pressure medications were held during this admission and only carvedilol and bumex were restarted at discharge. Others should be restarted gradually as blood pressures tolerate. - Biospies from EGD are pending at discharge - Should get creatinine re-checked on ___ given recent contrast load and patient's baseline CKD - Patient should f/u with Hem/Onc for potential treatment of his metastatic malignancy  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay. You were admitted due GI bleeding, due to a mass in your small intestine. You underwent an artery embolization in order to stop the blood supply to the bleeding mass. Afterwards, your bleeding resolved and your blood counts remained stable. 

Please continue to keep your appointments with your physicians. We wish you all the best.
