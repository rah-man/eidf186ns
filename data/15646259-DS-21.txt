The patient has a history of progressive gait ataxia, leg stiffness, and recurrent falls, which ultimately led to a C1 and C3 fracture. He then had an MRI showing severe cervical stenosis from C3-C7. He was admitted to ___ from ___ for C3-C7 laminectomy/fusion. His post-op course was complicated by upper extremity paresis with work up revealing a large seroma with abnormal cord signal at C5-C7. ___ was consulted and drained one of the two fluid collections with improvement in his symptoms. 

He was discharged to rehab, where his strength remained stable. Notably his wife reports he was able to use his right arm moderately well, minimal use of his left arm, and moderate BLE strength, able to walk a few steps. He was at his baseline until yesterday when his wife checked on him in the afternoon and found him slouched over in a wheelchair with his chin to his chest, without his C-collar in place. She reports he had minimal responsiveness for ___ minutes. He reportedly had no seizure-like activity, tongue biting or incontinence but it took a while for him to come to. He was also cold and was foaming at the mouth per his wife. 

EMS was called and he was transferred to ___, where he was found to be hemodynamically stable. Labs were notable for WBC 8, Cr 2, and CT head showed no acute intracranial process. CT C-spine revealed severe disc space narrowing at C3-C4, moderate to severe disc space narrowing at C4-C5, and moderate disc space narrowing at C5-C6 and C6-C7. He was transferred to ___ for further management.

___ Imaging PERC G/G-J TUBE PLMT FINDINGS:   1. Successful placement of a 18 ___ mic gastrostomy tube. 

___ Imaging VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWA FINDINGS:   There is aspiration with thin and nectar thick liquids.   IMPRESSION:   Aspiration with thin and nectar thick liquids. Mr. ___ presents with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia based on today's video swallow study, most notable for reduced oral control/containment, swallow delay, decreased hyolaryngeal movement, impaired pharyngeal bolus propulsion, and reduced laryngeal vestibular closure. There was silent aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids as well as deep penetration with pudding. There were no swallowing strategies that significantly decreased risk of aspiration. It is unclear at this time how much of pt's current swallow function is consistent with baseline vs. acutely worsened function s/p cervical ACDF on ___. Of note, the patient's mental status was adequate and appropriate during today's study.

At this time, there is no safe diet without high risk of aspiration. As such, recommend NPO status at this time to optimize safety. Strongly recommend consideration of long-term alternative means of nutrition/hydration/medication if within GOC. Continue with short-term NGT pending this decision.

Pt would benefit from ongoing swallowing tx here, as able, and at rehab. In therapy sessions, ___ may provide therapeutic PO of ___ tsp of nectar-thick liquids with use of supraglottic swallow strategy. Recommend consideration of repeat video swallow study in ___ weeks per ___ discretion based on progress in therapy. Given unclear chronicity of pt's dysphagia, prognosis for recovery of swallowing function is not entirely clear at this time; however, given that pt's recent ACDF is suspected to have worsened pt's swallow function, there is certainly a possibility that pt's swallowing function can improve with increased distance from this surgery.

Our service will continue to follow for ongoing dysphagia management as able. Please page ___ for questions/concerns.

___BD & PELVIS W/O CON 1. No convincing evidence of intra-abdominal infectious process within the limitations of a noncontrast study. 2. Status post bilateral lower quadrant renal transplant with mild fullness of the left lower quadrant collecting system without frank hydronephrosis.  Fluid, stranding and fascial thickening in the left lower abdomen in the region of the left pelvic transplant raises the possibility of acute pyelonephritis given the positive urinalysis. Evaluation however for pyelonephritis is not possible on noncontrast imaging. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

He underwent urgent ACDF of C3-C6 on ___. He had persistent weakness that improved slightly during the hospitalization. Hospital course was complicated by dysphagia s/p G-tube insertion, urinary retention, E coli bacteremia, pyelonephritis, ___, C diff colitis, anemia, and delirium. 

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED ======================== #Cervical cord compression, worst at C5-C6 #Cervical stenosis s/p C3-C7 cervical laminectomy & fusion #S/p ACDF C3-C6 Patient was found slumped over, unconsciousness without his neck brace on while at rehab. After regarding consciousness, he had acute on chronic weakness, particularly over the BUE that was associated with incontinence. He had significant diffuse weakness with minimal movement of his fingers and ___ strength over his BLE. He was placed in a hard collar with logroll precautions. MRI spine showed multilevel posterior disc protrusions and moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing from C3-C4 through C5-C6, most severe at C5-C6 with indentation of the spinal cord. He underwent urgent ACDF without issues. Repeat MRI done due to persistent weakness showed post-surgical changes without worsening cord compression or fluid collections. Ortho spine felt there was no need for dexamethasone. He worked with ___ who recommended d/c with continued rehabilitation. He should follow up with Dr. ___ in 2 weeks after discharge. 

#Acute on chronic dysphagia Previous the procedure, the patient had a long history of coughing after eating. Following the ACDF, the patient had significant trouble swallowing, noting to have coughing fits and trouble swallowing pills. He failed multiple speech and swallow evaluations in a row including video swallow study. Etiology was initially felt to be due to post-operative edema impacting his pharyngeal swallowing, common after ACDF and generalizing improves with time. however with lack of improvement during prolonged hospital course, there may a component of worsening chronic dysphagia I/s/o cervical spine procedure. He was placed on maintenance IV fluids, given tubefeeds through NGT which was transitioned to G-tube feeds. The patient worked with speech and swallow team to improve swallowing function with plans to continue rehabilitation with goal to take things by mouth when ready with removal of G-tube.

#E coli blood stream infection #E coli pyelonephritis #Septic shock: #Leukocytosis: Likely ___bdomen/pelvis findings. Blood cultures were sensitive to cefepime and CTX. He was initially treated with cefepime which was changed to ceftriaxone that was changed back for low grade fevers. He ultimately finished his course of 2 weeks antibiotics with ceftriaxone. Urine culture also grew pan-sensitive e coli. 

#ESRD s/p renal transplant ___ #Pyelnephritis #Urinary retention with obstruction #CMV detectable viral load Cr was 2.0 on admission, up from a baseline between 1.4-1.7. He was given intravenous fluids and his ___ resolved. His home prednisone was continued and his tacrolimus dose was decreased from 1.5 mg BID to 0.5 mg BID due to an elevated level, then was increased to 1.0 QAM and 0.5 QPM for therapeutic goal trough level of ___. He developed ___ during admission that was multifactorial including pre-renal i/s/o infection (improved with IV fluids), pyelnephritis as noted above, and post-renal with obstruction (improved with foley catheter, stable without discontinuation and intemittent straight cath). The patient had detectable viral load on ___ and ___ without ongoing evidence of end-organ CMV infection. These levels were drawn I/s/o low grade fevers, which resolved without anti-viral medications. We would recommend f/u on this and treatment as appropriate. The patient required sodium bicarbonate to reduce acidemia likely ___ to renal function. Would recommend discontinuation PRN.

#Urinary retention Developed urinary retention, likely from a component of cord compression with possible contribution from his recent surgery, hospitalization, and opioids. His home oxybutynin was held and he underwent intermittent straight catheterization. His urinary retention continued throughout the hospitalization and at discharge intermittently.

#Severe C diff colitis: Patient with initial C diff colitis infection with severity category of severe given peak WBC >15k and Creatinine >= 1.5. However, determination of the patient's C diff severity is complicated by concurrent E coli bloodstream infection and pyelonephritis as described above. He was treated initially with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin 125 QID for 14 days (___) with planned maintenance therapy for 1 week after d/c-ing other antibiotics (last day ___. His IV metronidazole was discontinued after resolution of leukocytosis after 3 days.

#Syncope/AMS Patient was found to be unresponsive and slouched over in a chair without his C-collar in place. Unclear if he had true syncope. Differential included neurogenic syncope vs seizure (particularly given history of seizures) vs arrhythmia. Stroke, PE, MI, or valvular disease were felt to be unlikely. CT head was negative and EKG was without ischemia. He was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmia nor recurrent events. 

#Delirium: the patient experienced delirium while in hospital likely related to toxic metabolic causes (particularly I/s/o GNR sepsis and septic shock), medication-induced with opioids. He was treatd with high-dose IV thiamine 500mg IV TID x 3d (___) in case of refeeding syndrome and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Opioid medications were discontinued.

#Anemia: the patient had downtrending hgb which may be related to slow GI bleed I/s/o flexiseal and last colonoscopy on record with 5mm benign polyp in ___ vs. bone marrow suppression in acute illness. He was transfused with iron with increase in reticulocyte count. B12 and folate normal. 

#DM type II, insulin dependent Patient on NPH at home. Initially, his home NPH was held given low BG and NPO status. His insulin regimen was adjusted for tubefeedings with BID dosing of glargine and sliding scale Q6H while on cycled tube feeds.

#Elevated Troponin Troponin elevated to 0.05 on admission, peaked at 0.06 iso renal disease. EKG with TWI in I, otherwise unremarkable. He remained asymptomatic. Felt to be type II from acute illness. He was continued on aspirin, pravastatin, and carvedilol. 

#Hyperkalemia (resolved): high K with peaked T waves in V3 and V4 more so than prior. High potassium may be related to poor renal clearance, glucerna tube feeds, and neutraphos standing that the patient was getting. He was treated with calcium gluconate, Lasix, and dext/insulin. Potassium levels improved with changing feeds from glucerna to nepro.

CHRONIC CONDITIONS: =================== #Hypertension: Continued amlodipine 10 mg daily and carvedilol 6.25 mg BID # Seizure disorder: Continued zonisamide # Restless legs syndrome: Continued ropinirole # Obstructive sleep apnea: Not on CPAP # Depression/Anxiety: Continued escitalopram and quetiapine # GERD: Continued omeprazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =================== [] ESRD s/p renal transplant.  [] CMV viral load detectable on ___ and ___ without starting medications. We recommend f/u CMV viral load check within ___ weeks of discharge and initiation of anti-viral medications PRN. [] Discharge creatinine: 0.9 [] Discharge tacrolimus trough 5.5 (for goal ___ on 1 mg PO QAM and 0.5 mg QPM (lowered from 1.5 mg BID) [] Acute on chronic dysphagia: continue rehabilitation work with speech and swallow team. Recommend maximizing PO intake when safe and removal of G-tube when tolerating PO safely. [] C diff colitis: patient to finish 7-day post-CTX PO vancomycin to finish C diff treatment. [] Anemia: improved retic count with IV iron transfusion x2. Would recommend f/u colonoscopy as outpatient and any other age-appropriate cancer screening. [] Acidemia: the patient had low serum bicarb with recommendation for supplementation per inpatient renal team. Recheck BMP in 1 week after discharge and management of bicarb supplementation PRN by transplant nephrology team.
