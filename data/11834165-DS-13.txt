MICRO BLOOD CULTURE X2 URINE CULTURE 

IMAGING STUDIES: - CXR (___): Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis, subpulmonic effusion not excluded.    - ECHO (___): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. ***IMPRESSION (sub-optimal image quality): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of ___, the regional left ventricular systolic function is new. Mild mitral regurgitation is now seen. The ascending aorta was not previously commented upon, but is now mildly dilated.

- GU U/S (___): IMPRESSION: 1. No hydronephrosis. Simple bilateral renal cysts. 2. Large postvoid residual seen in the urinary bladder. 3. Enlarged prostate. 

- CARDIAC CATH (___): 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated known three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a known chronic total occlusion in its mid portion. The LCx had an odd anatomy, with long left main and late origin of LCx. There were lesions in OM1 and OM2 of 80-90% (which had been called diagonals in the past) and lie on the lateral wall. The RCA had serial 70% lesions in its mid and distal portion, as well as a 90% on a high RPDA. 2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA to LAD, with a small and diffusely diseased LAD. 3. Venous conduit angiography demonstrated total occlusions of the SVG To OM1, OM2 and RPDA. 4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated central aortic blood pressure. 5. Adequate hemostasis was obtained with manual compression of the right common femoral arteriotomy site.   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Patent LIMA to LAD 3. Total occlusions of SVG to OM1, OM2 and RPDA.

ACUTE CARE # DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State: Pt initially w/ anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated glucose of 693 on admission suggestive of DKA. However, no evidence of ketones on UA, but does not account for beta-hydroxybutyrate. Serum acetone negative but sent after got insulin. Effective serum osmolality of 322 w/o osmolar gap largely from elevated glucose and urea, but would expect even higher glucose in HHS. Trigger could be acute cardiac event vs. infectious etiology given elevated WBC, though CXR w/o clear infiltrate and no prodrome of infectious symptoms. Has received 2L NS and 40 of potassium. A1c is 8.1- patient is diet-controlled at home. He was initially monitored on insulin gtt, and was then trasitioned to insulin subq. Due to this being a new diagnosis of diabetes, ___ was consulted. He was discharged with close ___ follow-up and sub-Q insulin BID dosing. 

# NSTEMI: Patient with h/o chest pain at rest and recent h/o CP in setting of exertion suggestive of unstable angina. On presentation he was noted to ahve EKG changes and elevated troponin consistent with NSTEMI. He was initially medically managed with the ACS protocol with heparin, statin, plavix, and BB as his renal function improved. Echo at this time showed new regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. He underwent cardiac cath which showed three vessel CAD with patent LIMA to LAD but total occlusions of SVG to OM1, OM2 and RPDA. None of these findings were amenable to stenting. After cath he was treated with maximal medical management, and was discharged on aspirin, statin, beta blocker, and ACEi. 

# ___: On admission he was notd to have a creatinine bump to 3.1 from baseline of 1.2 in ___. This acute kidney injury likely multifactorial, with contributions from significant auto-diuresis in setting of hyperosmolarity as above likely leading to volume depletion and decreased renal perfusion. Supported by initial blood pressure of 88/67 on admission. His renal function improved with IVF resuscitation. Given his known BPH, there was concern for an obstructive process as well, but this was not demonstrated on GU ultrasound. His renal function recovered and was downtrending on discharge. He was restared on his home doses of ACEi and HCTZ prior to discharge. 

# Polysubstance abuse: Heavy drinker at baseline- 1 pint per day. Reports last drink was on the evening of ___. On admission he denied h/o prior withdrawal. Also prior h/o heroin and cocaine use, though patient currently denies use of these substances. Urine and serum tox screens were negative on admission. He was monitored on CIWA, but he scored very infrequently. Social work ___ was placed for substance abuse support. 

CHRONIC ISSUES # Hypertension: Initially he was hypotensive, but this responded to IVF resuscitation. Ultimately he was restarted on lisinopril and HCTZ.  # Hyperlipidemia: In the setting of ACS protocol his statin was switched to atrovastatin. 

# Schizoaffective disorder: Per psych notes from ___, unclear if mood disorder component, but likely schizophrenic. Continued on home ziprasadone and fluoxetine.

# BPH: Has h/o urinary retention. Continued home tamsulosin. Renal U/S did not show any evidence of obstruction. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Newly diagnosed Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus started on insulin with BID dosing (breakfast and dinner), he may require uptitration of his insulin dosing as an outpatient.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Diabetic ketoacidosis, non-ST segment myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, substance abuse

Secondary: Schizoaffective disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.  Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ ___. You were admitted for treatment of your very high blood sugar and heart attack. You were initially admitted to the ICU to get close monitoring and insulin through your IV. Your blood sugar was able to be controlled with insulin shots, and you were able to transition to the cardiology floor. You were seen by the diabetes experts at the ___. On discharge you were started on a few new medications to treat your diabetes including insulin shots which should be taken before breakfast and dinner, as well as a pill called glipizide which you should also take prior to breakfast and dinner. It is very important to check your blood sugars twice a day (prior to breakfast and dinner). Please call your PCP ___ doctor if your blood sugar is greater than 400. 

While you were on the cardiology floor, you underwent a cardiac catheterization to evaluate the cause of your chest pain. This study showed that your prior CABG vessels are blocked off. You did not have any stents placed. You were treated with maximal medical management with aspirin, statin, and metoprolol. It is very important that you continue taking these medications to help keep your heart as healthy as possible.  Followup Instructions: ___
