 History of Present Illness: ___ yo healthy male presents from his PCPs office with leukocytosis to 30, generalized itching and weight loss over the past 7 months. The patient states that in ___ he noticed a bumpy non pruritic rash on the back of his arms and on his thighs. He went to the dermatologist who gave him a cream and acne solution that helped the rash somewhat. In ___ he went with his wife on a biking trip through ___ and ___ and at that time noticed a rash on his chest that was not itchy but later developed generalized "itchiness".

He also notes a non-productive cough that has been progressive for many months and is worse at night. He had an EGD which showed gastritis/esophagitis and he was started on zantac for this cough.  He otherwise denies chest pain or pressure, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, loss of sensation, weakness, travel to ___ or ___, easy bruising or bleeding, headache, changes in vision/taste/smell or hearing, fevers or chills.

              **FINAL REPORT ___

  URINE CULTURE (Final ___:  NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING ---------- CXR ___: 1. Left lower lobe linear opacities are likely atelectasis ; however in the appropriate clinical situation, infection not excluded. 2. Cardiomegaly without effusions or edema.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST ___: 1. Thickened appearance of the distal esophagus with a moderate hiatal hernia as well as esophageal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, which can be seen in gastroesophagitis. 2. Linear regions of atelectasis are noted in the bilateral lower lobes with bronchiectasis noted in the right lower lobe, possibly from recurrent episodes of prior aspiration.  RECOMMENDATION(S): Recommend further evaluation of the distal esophagus and stomach with an EGD.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ___: 1. Splenomegaly with mild upper abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of indeterminate etiology. 2. There is indeterminate 0.6 cm right iliac bone lucent lesion. 3. There is subtle capsular irregularity of the hepatic surface, correlate clinically to exclude early cirrhosis.

# Hypereosinophilia syndrome. The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms for the past 7 months consisting of rash, generalized pruritus, drenching sweats, and weight loss. He had called his PCP for ___ lab check on ___ because he felt that his pruritus had worsened. ___ at that time was significantly elevated prompting presentation to ___ on admission was found to be 30.4 and his differential showed 18,000 eosinophils. His symptoms are consistent with hypereosinophilic syndrome and with end organ symptoms (Skin, possibly GI, possibly renal, possibly liver), there is concern for a primary hematologic malignancy. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy on ___ with results pending at the time of discharge. CT chest was not concerning for obstructive lymphadenopathy or masses. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed splenomegaly with mild upper abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and a lucent lesion of the right iliac bone. TSH, cortisol, troponins, HIV Ig are unremarkable. IgA/IgG/IgM and B12 are elevated, with unclear significance at this time. 

# Pruritus. Patient with ___ disease confirmed on skin biopsy in ___. Likely exacerbated acutely in the setting of hypereosinophilia. For his itching he was treated with clobetasol mixed with Eucerin cream BID, to be used for no longer than 14 days. He will be seen by Dermatology as an outpatient. 

# Esophagitis: possibly related to hypereosinophilia. Continue home ranitidine.

# Insomnia: due to itching. Continue trazadone PRN.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ due to a significantly elevated subset of white blood cells (eosinophilia), which is a marker of infection versus inflammation. We suspect that these lab abnormalities are related to dysfunction of your bone marrow. A sample of your bone marrow was taken for further evaluation.

You also underwent imaging of your abdomen and pelvis which did reveal a lesion of your right hip bone. You should undergo a total body bone scan as an outpatient to evaluate for any additional lesions.

For your itching, you should mix Clobetasol cream with Eucerin and apply this mixture twice a day to the affected skin, for no more than 14 days. You should attend your follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ below ******.

It is important that you attend follow-up appointments with your PCP, ___, and dermatology as listed below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you! We wish you the best!

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
