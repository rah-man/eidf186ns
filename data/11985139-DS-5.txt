# CAD: s/p DES to proximal and distal circumflex lesions in ___. She underwent cardiac cath on ___ for unstable angina with DES to LAD. At that time, the high-grade RCA stenosis was not treated as it unclear whether it was suitable for PCI. She was discharged in ___ with 3 vessel CAD and difficult to control angina despite LAD PCI. She was not thought to be a candidate for CABG because she is a Jehova's Witness. She was started on diltiazem 120mg CR in addition to metoprolol XL 100mg, ranolazine 1000mg BID, and isosorbide mononitrate 150mg daily in ___ because she had ongoing angina. This admission, her diltiazem was held given marked bradycardia and amlodipine was started for anginal control. She had coronary angiography showing patent LCx and LAD stents. She underwent high-risk PCI to RCA territory with DES to mid-RCA and DES to proximal and ostial RCA. She was continued on aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, ranolazine, isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol succinate, and amlodipine was started to replace diltiazem in an effort to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Medications were maximized (See discharge meds) 

# Sinus bradycardia: Patient presented with bradycardia that was junctional alternating with sinus in the ___ with presyncope in the setting of mild hypovolemia due to prior emesis. Her home AV nodal blockers (diltiazem 120 mg CR & metoprolol succinate 100 mg) were held, and were suspected to be the cause of her bradycaria. When her heart rate improved to the ___ her metoprolol was restarted at a lower dose. Diltiazem was not restarted. It was originally prescribed for refractory angina despite maximal medical therapy in the setting of known 3VD with RCA territory that was not previously intervened upon given complexity of PCI. She was started on amlodipine to replace diltiazem. 

# Presyncope: Low cardiac output either related to depressed HR or to depressed SV (from hypovolemia secondary to emesis). Labs showed improved Cr after 1L IVF, suggesting likely hypovolemic component exacerbating her bradycardia and contributing to presyncope. 

# DMII: Held home metformin. Continue home glargine 20 units qHS and HISS 

# Glaucoma: Continued on home latanoprost

# Anemia: Unchanged H&H since last admission. Continued B12, FeSO4

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: Angina Coronary artery disease Sinus and junctional bradycaria Superficial foot laceration

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___, you were admitted to ___ for a very slow heart rate (bradycardia). We think your heart rate was slow because of medications (metoprolol and diltiazem). We lowered your doses for these medications and your heart rate improved. While you were here you had ongoing chest pain. We thought that this was because of blocked arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease) preventing oxygen flow to the heart. You were taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on ___ where two stents were placed to your right coronary artery. We hope that this will improve your chest pain. We adjusted some of your medications and it is VERY important that you stop taking diltiazem and only take the medications on the new list we give you. 

We also noticed a small cut under your right big toe that did not look infected. You will need regular wound care. We made an appointment for podiatry (foot doctor) follow up. It is important to go to this appointment and check your blood sugars frequently.

Please call your doctor if you become lightheaded or feel like you are going to lose consciousness.  Followup Instructions: ___
