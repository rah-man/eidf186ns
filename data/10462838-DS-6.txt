 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. You were admitted with a skin infection of your right shin. We began to treat you with IV drugs to resolve your infection. You responded very well to these and we were able to switch you to antibiotics taken by mouth. You continued to do very well. Your condition was very painful and required an opiate painkiller called oxycodone. You will be discharged on two antibiotics to fight off the leg infection and oxycodone for pain.
