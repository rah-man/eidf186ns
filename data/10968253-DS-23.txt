IMAGING: --------

___ CXR: Pulmonary edema now involves all of both lungs, moderately severe throughout. Aeration in the lower lobes has improved minimally. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement both worsened compared to ___. Bilateral pleural effusion is presumed, could be substantial on the right. No pneumothorax. 

___ abdominal XR: There is a non-specific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction. There are no radiopaque foreign bodies. There are no acute fractures or dislocations. IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction. 

___ ECHO: The left atrial volume is severely increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present without evidence of valve dehiscence. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, transaortic gradients are higher with similar degree of paravalvular leak. There is more mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary pressures are significantly higher. Other findings are similar.

___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a reoccurrence of the pre-existing pulmonary edema. The image resembles ___. Again,mild blunting of the costophrenic sinuses is seen, right more than left, suggesting coexisting mild pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly, stable appearance of the sternal wires, the valvular replacement, and the right PICC line.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with PMHx of CKD, CAD (s/p CABG), AS (sp AVR), HTN, recurrent UTI ___ urinary obstruction and BPH(s/p TURP) presents from his living center with improving respiratory distress, anemia s/p 1U PRBCs, hyperkalemia and ___.

ACUTE ISSUES: ============== # Respiratory distress: The patient presented with dyspnea and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. His volume overload was most likely due to diastolic HF with preserved EF exacerbated by volume overload from acutely decompensated CKD. An ECHO showed severe dilation of the left atrium, elevated pulmonary pressures, and preserved systolic function. His dyspnea resolved after receiving 60-120 mg of IV furosemide with metolazone daily for three days. He was then restarted on torsemide, with the dose increased to 10 mg from his home dose of 5 mg. On this increased dose, pt was able to maintain I/O's roughly even. 

# Hyperkalemia: The patient's K on admission was elevated at 6.1 without EKG changes in the setting of worsening renal function.  He was successfully treated for hyperkalemia with D50, insulin, calcium gluconate, and IV lasix diuresis. He was then re-started on torsemide at 10 mg per day. On discharge, his K was stable at 4.3.

# Acute on Chronic kidney disease: The patient has had a progressive decline in renal function, and presented to ___ with a Cr of 3.9 from baseline 3.1. In discussion with his primary nephrologist, it was determined that pt was not a candidate for dialysis due to declining cognitive function. This was reiterated in conversations with nephrology and with the patient's son during this visit. The patient was continued on his home bicarb and maintained on a renal diet. Of note, pt responded to diuresis well during his hospital course and continued to have normal range urine output.

# CA-UTI: The patient's urine on admission grew proteus, sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient was asymptomatic, but he was treated given his multiple comorbidities. He received ceftriaxone 1g q24h and completed a ___nemia: The patient's hematocrit on admission was 18, down from a baseline of approximately ___. His hematocrit bumped to ___ after 1U PRBCs and remained stable after that time. Further work-up of his anemia revealed relative reticulocytopenia, normal thyroid function, normal LFTs, normal B12/folate. In the absence of these sources of macrocytic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome is a possible etiology. We did not do further work-up given goals of care as discussed with the patient's son, who is his HCP. He was hemodynamically stable throughout his admission.  CHRONIC ISSUES: ============== # HTN: The patient was continued on his home metoprolol and amlodipine. 

# CAD s/p CABG w/ AVR: The patient was continued on his home atorvastatin and metoprolol.

# Hyperlipidemia: The patient was continued on his home atorvastatin.

# Constipation: Patient was treated with miralax, docusate, senna, and bisacodyl.

# GOUT: The patient's home renally dosed allopurinol was held during this admission. He had no gout flare during this admission. On discharge, pt's allopurinol was restarted.

# Seizure disorder: Previous discharge summaries mentioned a seizure in the setting of taking ertepenem. The patient was briefly on Keppra but is no longer taking this medication. He had no seizure activity while inpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== # Subacute Hct drop: The patient's hct on admission was 18, down from ___ at baseline. Occult GIB is a possible etiology for his subacute drop in Hct, as his stool was guiac positive at an OSH. He had no evidence of ongoing bleed while inpatient. ___ consider further GI work-up as an outpatient.  # Volume status: The patient's torsemide was increased to 10 mg (from 5) during this admission given his persistent hypervolemia. It will be important to monitor his weight and in's and out's on this new dose to ensure that he is adequately diuresed while still maintaining sufficient volume to perfuse his kidney. In general, his daily in's and out's should be approximately equal.

# Goals of care: We spoke extensively with Mr. ___ son about goals of care. He is aware that his father's renal disease is end-stage. He reaffirmed that his father would not undergo dialysis. His primary goal is his father's ___, and he would like the patient to avoid hospitalization whenever possible. Ongoing conversations with providers at Mr. ___ ___ about goals of care, as well as discussion of indications for hospitalizations within these goals of care, will be useful.

# Transportation to ___: The patient's son would like to move him to ___, and he has begun to research nursing facilities. The son will need assistance in coordinating transit to ___ once he has found an appropriate facility for Mr. ___.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___. You were admitted with high potassium, low blood counts, and difficulty breathing.  Your difficulty breathing was most likely due to extra fluid in your lungs resulting from your renal disease. We treated you with diuretics which help you urinate. This improved your breathing. We also gave you several medications that lower your potassium. You also received a blood transfusion to help increase your blood count. Finally, you were treated with a short course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.  

Please call your doctor if your breathing worsens, you develop ankle swelling, or you gain greater than 3 pounds.

We are increasing your home dose of Torsemide to 10 mg to help prevent you from retaining extra fluid and developing breathing difficulties.

We wish you all the best, Your ___ team
