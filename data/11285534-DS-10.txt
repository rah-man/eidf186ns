Clinical significance of isolate(s)    uncertain. Interpret with caution.    PROTEUS MIRABILIS.  10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. . EKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave changes with T wave inversion in leads V4-V6. Prolonged Q-T interval. Delayed R wave transition in the precordial leads. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the rate is slower and the T wave inversions are new. Clinical correlation is suggested. ___ ___ . CXR ___: No evidence for acute disease or injury. . EKG ___: Sinus bradycardia. Prolonged Q-T interval. Compared to tracing #1 T wave inversion and downsloping ST segment are now noted in leads V3 and V6. This may be related to myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. ___ ___ with history of CKD, HTN, DM2, and gout presents 3 days of R flank pain and incidentally noted to have supraventricular tachycardia.

# Supraventricular Tachycardia: Patient has this prior diagnosis based on Holter monitoring in past as performed by her PCP. She has ongoing palpitations ~2x/month for a few seconds similar to what she had in outpt setting today and this is not a new issue. She had negative cardiac anzymes but we did not pursue further investigation for PE, as this arrhythmia was pre-existing and previously worked up. She also did not have any symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. Outpatient stress testing could be considered given ECG changes. Atenolol was changed to metoprolol given borderlien renal function.

# Back/Flank Pain: Likely related to MSK back pain. Pain was reproducible on exam and started in the setting of lifting gradndaughter from wheelchair. Unlikely to be GI given only GI sx was anorexia, and this largely resolved during the admission. Has intermittent diarrhea at baseline. She was prescribed lidocaine patch, acetaminophen, and tramadol with significant improvement in symptoms.

# Nephrolithiasis: Asymptomatic, as pain was on right and stone was on left. She was given IV fluids. HCTZ was stopped to decrease risk of recurrent nephrolithiasis in future.

# ___ on CKD: Likely in setting of decreased PO intake. Stone unlikely to be related given no evidence of effects on kidney on imaging. Improved to baseline with IV fluids. ___ was held and restarted on discharge.

# HTN/HLD: HCTZ was stopped. ___ was held and restarted on discharge. Amlodipine was continued. We switched atenolol to metoprolol given renal failiure.

# DM: Glargine was continued. She was put on HISS while in house. Glipizide was stopped. 

# Gout: Continued home allopurinol.

Transitional Issues: - Full code. - Potassium level should be checked as an outpatient within a week of discharge given the stopping of HCTZ and the continuation ___ and potassium supplement. - Patient should have outpatient follow up for microscopic hematuria with repeat UA to ensure resolved after passage of stone. - Pelvic U/S was recommended several years ago by OB/GYN. Patient agreed to set this up through PCP. - CT abdomen pre-admission at ___ revealed several findings that require outpatient follow-up: pulmonary nodules, fatty infiltration of the liver, and hyperdense renal lesion. - Patient will follow up with GI for chronic diarrhea and food intolerance.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Muscular strain Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.  Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with back and abdominal pain.  This was likely due to muscular strain. Please use the lidocaine and acetaminophen for pain, and please continue with normal light activity, but avoid strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until you're feeling better.

You were also found to have a kidney stone that should pass on its own. However, please be sure you drink plenty of water, even if you have a decreased appetite.

Please follow up with a cardiologist about your rapid heart rate and about getting a stress test.

Please follow up with your gastroenterologist about your diarrhea and food intolerance.

Please follow up with your primary care doctor, who can help set you up with pelvic ultrasound that was recommended by Dr. ___ ___ years ago. Your PCP may also recommend a follow up CT scan or studies of your urine based on the results of lab tests and CT scan that you had before and during the current hospitalization. 

Attached please find an updated list of medications.

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___.  Followup Instructions: ___
