Chief Complaint: MRSA bacteremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Temporary HD line ___ MRI of spine and R hip requiring anesthesia

 History of Present Illness: ___ is a ___ woman with a history of HTN, IDDM (A1c 6.5%), obesity, HFpEF, CAD, OSA, ESRD on HD ___ (initiated in ___, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, presenting as a transfer from ___ with MRSA bacteremia.

Per outside records, the patient was admitted to ___ on ___ after being noted to have progressive confusion after HD that day. On initial evaluation she was noted to be hypoxic to 87% on RA and encephalopathic, with labs notable for troponin elevation with peak of 0.61 and leukocytosis to 15.7. CT head and CXR were reportedly unremarkable at that time. Blood cultures drawn at HD from the ___ and sent to ___ grew GPC in clusters, and subsequently each blood culture drawn at ___ until ___ grew MRSA (sensitivities otherwise unknown). Tunneled HD line was removed ___ with culture tip also growing Staph. The patient was treated with vancomycin and aztreonam before ID consult recommended de-escalation to vancomycin alone. There was concern for additional infectious nidus given persistence of positive cultures after removal of HD line; patient reportedly had right hip pain so there was a plan to obtain CT hip to evaluate for effusion, but this did not occur prior to transfer.

Hospital course also notable for respiratory failure requiring brief MICU stay that was attributed to volume overload and OSA. 

The patient underwent HD through LUE fistula on ___, but the fistula reportedly clotted 45 minutes into the session and HD was aborted. Nephrology team at ___ recommended transfer to ___ as surgeon who placed fistula is here. 

On arrival to the floor, patient is somewhat confused, though she denies pain and dyspnea. She reports she was transferred here for further evaluation of her fistula.

RENAL US ___ FINDINGS:  The evaluation is limited secondary to patient body habitus. No hydronephrosis. No large stones. No worrisome masses.  Echogenic appearance of the renal cortex is more notable on the left than on the right. This appearance is concerning for chronic medical renal disease. A right renal simple cyst measures up to 4.0 cm.  Right kidney: 9.2 cm Left kidney: 8.7 cm  The bladder is only minimally distended and can not be fully assessed on the current study.  IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis. Echogenic kidneys, with atrophy more notable on the leftthan right, likely reflect chronic medical renal disease.

AVF Duplex ___ IMPRESSION:  Grossly patent left upper extremity radial artery to cephalic vein fistula. Velocities in the arterial site of the fistula are slightly elevated. Volumetric flow through the fistula is suboptimal at 470 mL/min.

AV FISTULOGRAM ___ FINDINGS:  1. Short to medium length segment complete thrombosis of the left cephalic arch. 2. Restoration of flow but persistent areas of narrowing in the left cephalic arch after 6 and 7 mm balloon plasty. 3. Almost complete resolution of the areas of narrowing in the left cephalic arch after 8 mm balloon plasty. 4. Deployment of a 9 mm x 5 cm Viabahn stent in the left cephalic arch.. 5. Final digital subtraction venogram demonstrated brisk antegrade flow into the SVC and right atrium and no visualization of the collaterals which likely jailed off by the stent.  IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory appearance following fistulogram and deployment of a 9 mm x 5 cm Viabahn stent in the left cephalic arch with a good angiographic and clinical result.

TTE ___ CONCLUSION: The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient.

The abdominal aorta is mildly dilated. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. A moderate (~1 cm,mobile) echodensity is seen on the left atrial side of the mitral valve, immediately adjacent to the dense posterior annular calcification. The echodensity likely represents mobile calcification, but a thrombus or vegetation (or mixed etiology) is also possible. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/ vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.

There is a partially occlusive thrombus in the distal right internal jugular vein which terminates before the bifurcation of the subclavian vein. The left internal jugular vein is patent. The bilateral axillary, and brachial veins are patent, show normal color flow, spectral doppler, and compressibility. The bilateral basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, compressible and show normal color flow.  A left upper extremity cephalic vein to basilic artery fistula is present.  IMPRESSION:  Partially occlusive thrombus within the right internal jugular vein which terminates before the bifurcation with the subclavian vein.  MRI HIP W/WO CONTRAST ___ IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis. 2. Nonspecific asymmetric muscular edema about the muscles of the pelvis and hip, could represent low-grade strain or infectious/inflammatory myositis, without abscess.

Brief Hospital Course: ___ woman with a history of HTN, IDDM (A1c 6.5%), obesity, HFpEF, CAD, OSA, ESRD on HD ___ (initiated in ___, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who presented as a transfer from ___ with MRSA bacteremia with unclear source and hypoxic respiratory failure likely ___ volume overload. During her hospitalization, she had an extensive workup that was revealing for likely infected blood clot in both AVF and RIJ, presumed endocarditis as well as L4-L5 discitis. Per ID recommendations, she should continue IV vancomycin with HD through ___. Her hospital course was further complicated by line associated clot requiring intiation of anticoagulation. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====================== [] Patient treated for MRSA persistent bacteremia c/b presumed endocarditis and L4-L5 discitis. Per ID recommendation she should be to continue on vancomycin dosed with hemodialysis ___ through ___. [] Essential Dates for OPAT therapy: - first date of negative blood cx ___ - tunneled RIJ HD line removed ___ [] *PLEASE OBTAIN WEEKLY CRP for patients with bone/joint infections and endocarditis or endovascular infections while on vancomycin. [] The ___ will schedule follow up and contact the patient or discharge facility. All questions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics after discharge should be directed to the ___ R.N.s at ___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the clinic is closed. All questions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics after discharge should be directed to the ___ R.N.s at ___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the clinic is closed. [] Per discussion with renal team at ___, patient's home diuretic was held given successful UF during HD sessions. The patient was discharged from the hospital without a diuretic but this should be re-evaluated if it is difficult to remove fluid. [] Patient's home amlodipine and imdur were held in the setting of hypotension during HD. These medications were held throughout her hospitalization given normotension despite holding these medications raising concern for possible medication non-compliance prior to admission. These medications were also held at discharge but patient should have close follow up of her blood pressure following discharge. [] During hospitalization patient noted to have line associated DVT and started on apixaban 5mg BID. Plan to anticoagulate for 3 months. Patient started on ___ with prospective end date ___. [] Patient found to have mass on mitral valve thought likely to be calcification that was likely infected versus endocarditis versus clot. Patient was evaluated by cardiology and cardiac surgery who recommended repeat TTE following antibiotics course (prospective date: after ___ and continue antibiotics and anticoagulation for the time courses previously described. Notably, the indication for her Apixaban is NOT cardiac thrombosis (it is DVT). [] Patient with Type II NSTEMI at OSH thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of infection. Recommend outpatient stress for further evaluation. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES: ==================== #MRSA bacteremia: Persistent MRSA bacteremia that was likely originally from tunneled HD line removed at OSH given positive tip culture, but there was concern for seeding of a separate site given refractory bacteremia despite line removal. Pleural effusion assessed and only minimal R pleural effusion; not drained. TTE concerning for endocarditis w/ mitral valve abnormality- a moderate sized (0.6 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) mobile echodensity seen on the left atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve which per cards evaluation is quite consistent w/ endocarditis, would not benefit from further evaluation with TEE since they visualized it quite well on the TTE. CT A&P w/out acute pathology. RUE US w/ partially occlusive thrombus within the right internal jugular vein which terminates before the bifurcation with the subclavian vein and may explain her prolonger bacteremia (infected clot) which abated after line removal. MRI full spine and hip revealed L4-L5 discitis with paraspinal edema likely causing her right-sided pain. The persistence of the bacteremia was thought to be due to additional infection of clot in either the AVF or R IJ both of which were removed as below, possible endocarditis (reviewed below), or L4-L5 discitis. She was continued on vancomycin and started on ceftaroline as well, but ceftaroline was discontinued per ID recommendations. Vancomycin should be continued through ___ given finding of L4-L5 discitis for full ___ week course. 

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient presented with tachypnea and O2 requirement thought likely ___ volume overload. Home torsemide was held. Received Lasix with limited effect. Temp HD line placed ___. Underwent HD which was initially limited by hypotension. Possibly pneumonia seen on OSH CT chest, however repeat NCCT chest at ___ w/ pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion, but without pneumonia. his was evaluated by IP and determined to be too small to tap. It resolved with further HD. Home anti-HTN was held to give BP room for volume removal w/ HD. Patient underwent dialysis ___ with resolution of respiratory symptoms. 

#ESRD on HD: #Clotted fistula: On ___ schedule. Fistula reportedly clotted at OSH after 45 minutes of use on ___. Volume overloaded likely from missing HD due to clotted fistula. Temporary HD line placed ___ and subsequently removed on ___. HD was initially limited by hypotension, so home antihypertensives were held. ___ was consulted for fistulogram. during fistulogram (___) patient was found to have clot which was removed and HD was continued thereafter through AVF. Continued nephrocaps, sevelamer, calcitriol

#Right Lower Quadrant Pain During the hospitalization, patient began reporting significant RLQ pain of unclear etiology. Abdominal imagining including US and CT showed no acute abdominal process. Given persistence of RLQ patient underwent MRI which she initially did not tolerate, but later successfully completed with anesthesia where she was found to have L4-L5 discitis as well as muscle strain of the R abdominal wall. It was thought that her pain was referred from these two sites. There was no evidence of associated osteomyelitis of the R hip contributing to her pain. Her pain was managed with tylenol, lidocaine patch and low dose oxycodone. 

#Mass on TTE Patient with mass on mitral valve on TTE. Although there was good visualization of the mass, it is unclear what this mass is (vegetation, thrombus, calcification). Per cardiology likely calcification or endocarditis. No additional imaging warranted at this time. C-surg recommends no indication for surgery. Patient was treated both with antibiotics in the setting that mass was endocarditis, and was on anticoagulation with apixaban for possible clot. 

#R Internal Jugular DVT Line associated DVT from recent HD temp line. Potentially another source of infection. Patient was initially placed on a heparin gtt but was transitioned to apixaban with plan to treat for 3 months (start date ___. 

#Splenic Infarction Patient noted on MRI to have splenic infarcts. The etiology of these infarcts was thought to be either septic emboli from presumed endocarditis or from clots (known clots in AVF and RIJ). Thereby patient was treated with both antibiotics and anticoagulation as explained elsewhere. 

#R knee effusion #Chondrocalcinosis Presented with R knee pain and effusion on XR. Tapped by ortho ___. <50k PMNs and no growth to date on culture with positive blood cultures, unlikely infected per ortho. Findings c/w chondrocalcinosis on XR. 

#Acute encephalopathy: Confusion likely toxic-metabolic in nature from renal failure with inadequate HD and ongoing infection. CT head negative for acute process at OSH. Mental status improved with treatment of infection as described above. 

#CAD s/p stent to LAD: #Type II MI: At OSH, trop peak at 0.61->0.49 and EKG w/o acute changes, likely demand NSTEMI from infection. Nuclear stress in ___ normal perfusion. Continued ASA and atorvastatin. HTN meds as below.

#HTN: Held amlodipine, imdur for HD as described above. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: ====================== #Normocytic anemia: Stable with prior, likely from renal disease. Patient demonstrated no signs of active bleeding. She did receive 1u pRBCs on ___. 

#DM2: Continued on glargine 4U and ISS.

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home atorvastatin.

#Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops .

 Discharge Instructions: Dear ___,   It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___! 

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  - You were admitted for bacteria in your blood.  What was done for me while I was in the hospital?  - You received antibiotics for your infection. - You received medications (diuretics) to help remove fluid from your lungs. - You got a temporary dialysis line which was removed once your fistula was fixed. - You got dialysis. - You had an MRI with anesthesia that showed the blood infection also affected a disc in the spine. This can be treated with the antibiotics you are receiving. We think this is what was causing the pain in your side. - We found a blood clot in your neck, so started you on a medicine called apixaban which is a blood thinner.

What should I do when I leave the hospital?  - Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Continue taking your medications as directed. - Keep all of your follow-up appointments.  Sincerely,  Your ___ Care Team 

 Followup Instructions: ___
