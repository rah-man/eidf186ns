CXR: FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous.    IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial infarct. Ventricles and sulci are more prominent than in ___ and compatible with global age-related volume loss. There is no shift of normally midline structures. Basal cisterns are preserved. Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Mild hypoattenuation in the left subinsular region is likely sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. No osseous abnormality is identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The right mastoid air cells are under developed. The left mastoid air cells are clear.   IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old ___ male with a pmh of frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, paranoid schizophrenia, GERD, and chronic Hep C who presented from ___ with recurrent fevers since ___ without a clear source.  # Fever. Currently with a negative work-up. There were several concerns. He had a leukocytosis and fever to 103 in the ED, WBCs on his UA, with concern for chronic aspiration and a midline line IV in place on admission. Blood, lung, and urine were all potential sources. He had cultures sent for all three sources and had been covered with levo, flagyl, and vanc at his NH. His urine culture was negative, sputum grew yeast and respiratory flora and his blood cultures were NGTD at discharge. He was initially covered broadly with vanc and imipenem out of concern for aspiration, but CXR and sputum pointed away from this. He was narrowed after 48 hours to Ciprofloxacin and remained afebrile. His midline was removed. 

# Hyponatremia. 150 on admission, likely from decrease in PO intake, and inability to access free water with increased insensible losses. He was given 2L NS in the ED and Repleted with D5W at 125cc/hr which corrected his sodium to 143. He was able to take fluids PO without coughing. He will need a formal speech and swallow evaluation to determine what he will be able to take by mouth going forward. 

# Frontotemporal dementia/Parkinsonism. He failed a trial of treatment in the past with worsening psychosis on antiParkinsonian meds. Currently on bupropion and mirtazapine and treating insomnia with lorazepam.

# Somnolence: Unclear etiology during his stay. He had waxing and waning and the differential included hypoactive delirium complicated by acute illness. Also likely a medication effect. He had received metoclopramide standing during admission. This was discontinued for somnolence. His psychiatric medications were also held for 1 dose and bupropion was halved in dosing to 37.5mg BID, with mirtazapine and lorazepam being made prn due to somnolence. As he continues to clinically improve his medications can be uptitrated as he tolerates to his regular dosing.

However, your fevers broke and you were treated with Ciprofloxacin, and you will require 7 days total of antibiotics. 

The midline IV in your right arm was discontinued out of concern that this was the source of your infection. 

You also had periods of somnolence that was likely related to your acute illness and medications.  Followup Instructions: ___
