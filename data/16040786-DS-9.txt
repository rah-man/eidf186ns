 History of Present Illness: ___ male with history of afib ( on coumadin), DM type II, HTN, s/p distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and cholecystectomy, presenting with recurrence of a right infrapatellar septic bursitis. Patient was admitted to the hospital previously and received IV vancomycin transitioned to oral dicloxacillin. During his recent admission, he was referred to ___ ED by his PCP for progressive knee pain and swelling a week after a fall from his bike, with concern for septic joint. Rt knee Xray showed a large suprapatellar joint effusion and soft tissue swelling adjacent to the medial distal femoral condyle with no evidence of fractures. Orthopedic surgery aspirated the joint, but were able to extract little fluid, and gram stain/culture were negative. Septic arthritis was thought to be unlikely, and his symptoms were thought to be most consistent with septic bursitis. Drainage was deferred at the time due to concern for a chronic draining sinus. He was empirically started on IV Vancomycin 1gm q12 and was subsequently transitioned to PO Dicloxacillin 500mg q6, given his history of MSSA and not MRSA, with clinical improvement on diclocxacillin and eventual discharged with outpatient antibiotics.  He reports that he finished the dicloxacillin and was feeling much better until 4 days ago. He was seen at ___ by his PCP ___ ___ and he was noted to be much improved.

Labs were notable for a lactate of 2.4, WBC count 10.1, platelets 675. He was given 1g IV vancomycin and percocet for pain and admitted to medicine for IV antibiotics.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of AFib (currently on coumadin), DM type II, HTN, s/p distal pancreatectomy/ splenectomy/ cholecystectomy on ___, with infrapatellar bursitis, recently treated with IV vacomycin and discharged on dicloxacillin, now presenting with worsening erythema, pain, swelling. 

ACTIVE ISSUES #Presumed Septic Bursitis- See HPI above, patient was evaluated for possible septic arthritis causing symptoms at last admission, but eventually it was thought that this diagnosis was unlikely, and that symptoms were more consistent with septic bursitis. Although I and D is sometimes required for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons to manage septic bursitis, this was deferred at the time due to concern for creating a chronic draining sinus and also due to clinical improvement, first on IV vancomycin, and eventually on oral dicloxacillin prior to discharge. Patient now returns with worsening pain, erythema swelling around right knee, elevated lactate, gradually worsening over four days since completing his course of dicloxacillin. He also reports night sweats. He was seen at ___ earlier today and with unsuccessful attempt at bursa drainage. Orthopedics was consulted and recommended against aspiration and drainage due to creation of a sinus tract and reaccumulation. At___ gram stain and culture showed no growth and no microrganisms as of ___. Gout bursitis is also possible but unlikely in an isolated joint without other symptoms. Given Vancomycin IV, pain controlled with percocet. Lactate and WBC were followed and decreased, and he had no clinical signs of systemic spread of infection. Switched to PO regimen, Amox 500mg TID and Bactrim DS BID to continue for 1 week.

#Atrial Fibrillation- On warfarin, but at last hospitalization was noted to have INR trending up to 3.9 with antibiotics. Coumadin was held at discharge and INR was found to be 1.7 at last clinic appointment on ___, and he resumed warfarin at that time. INR 1.9 on admission. Held warfarin while admitted and continued verapamil. He was directed to resume warfarin but to get his INR checked daily while taking antibiotics.

CHRONIC ISSUES #BPH- Continued finastaride  #HTN- Continued with verapamil  #HPL- continued with Pravastatin  #Gout- continued with colchicine.  #DM II: Held metformin and maintained on insulin sliding scale. 

#Depression- continue Sertraline  #Corneal edema- Continue Timolol Maleate and Brimonidine Tartrate
