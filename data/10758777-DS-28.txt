She represented to the ER for syncope.  Re her recent admission for hyperkalemia, EKG showed no changes and K normalized quickly. At that time UA notes some hematuria. 

She was discharged and felt at her baseline (she has been feeling week over the past few months) and this morning woke up with "crampy" abd pain that rad to her back. She felt she couldnt find a comfortable position which is how she usually feels when she has a kidney stone.

IMAGING: -------- CT abd/pelvis ___  Final Report INDICATION: Right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea, urinary frequency, and urgency, UA with blood.   COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis, ___.   TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were taken through the abdomen and pelvis without the administration of IV contrast due to the patient's stage III chronic kidney disease. Coronal and sagittal reformats were also examined.   DLP: 422.43 mGy-cm.   FINDINGS: The lung bases are clear. Coronary artery calcifications are noted.  Hyperdensity of the liver is consistent with changes from chronic amiodarone. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen is enlarged, measuring 23 cm, consistent with patient's known history of myelodysplastic syndrome.  The pancreas is unremarkable without peripancreatic stranding or fluid collection. The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with a 2 mm obstructing stone seen at the right ureterovesicular junction.  Several additional calculi are seen in the right and left renal pelves. A hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney is consistent with a simple cyst. The left renal collecting system is unremarkable. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable without any evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. The colon also maintains a normal caliber. There is no abdominal free fluid or free air. There are no abdominal wall hernias. Significant atherosclerotic disease is present in the abdominal aorta, common iliac arteries and splenic artery. The bladder is moderately distended. The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. No pelvic free fluid. There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 

No suspicious lesion is seen in the visualized osseous structures. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted.   IMPRESSION:  1. 2 mm obstructing stone at the right ureterovesicular junction. 2. Redemonstration of chronic findings, including splenomegaly, hyperdense liver, and atherosclerotic disease. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ h/o myeloproliferative dysplastic syndrome (JAK2+, Transfusion dependent for pRBC q1-2 wks, Myelofibrosis, splenomegaly), dCHF, multiple UTIs and kidney stones (tx with lithotripsy before) presented to the ER earlier today with abd and back pain and found to have a 2 mm kidney stone on the right and shortly after d/c from ED she syncopized and is being admitted for syncope workup and kidney stone. 

ACUTE ISSUES ------------ #Orthostatic Syncope: She syncopized in the ER waiting room on her way home in setting of standing up. Notably she did not eat anything the whole day, looked dry on exam, and felt thirsty on admission. The constellation of home antihypertensives, low PO intake all day, opiates in the ER for renal colic, and syncope on standing all suggest orthostatic syncope from hypovolemia. She had no post-ictal symptoms or stereotyped movements. Upon returning to the ED, she had a systolic BP of 87 mmHg that improved to the 120s with 500 mL IVF. She had no EKG changes suggestive of ischemia and recent TTE from ___ showed no LV outflow tract obstruction. She was evaluated by ___ and was no longer orthostatic ___ and was cleared to safely return home w/o services. Instructed not to use tamsulosin at home even though she filled this Rx yesterday because the risks of hypotension/orthostasis were felt to outweight the benefits of more rapid stone passage. Her home metoprolol was discontinued after speaking to her cardiologist Dr. ___ she has both chronic fatigue and evidence of relative bradycardia with exertion/standing. She otherwise continued her home medications, including amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation. 

#Right sided kidney stone: This prompted her initial ED evaluation ___. Pt has history of kidney stones in the past that she believes were uric acid. This is consistent with increased purine turn over in marrow from ineffective hematopoiesis. She has failed citrate treatment previously due to diarrhea per patient. She is followed by Dr. ___ in urology. Prior UAs and UA from today with hematuria. 2 mm obstructing stone at the right UVJ seen on CT. After admission was pain free. Had analgesics from ER discharge. Instructed not to use tamsulosin at home even though she filled this Rx yesterday because the risks of hypotension/orthostasis were felt to outweight the benefits of more rapid stone passage. 

CHRONIC ISSUES -------------- #End stage myeloproliferative dysplastic syndrome (JAK2 positive myeloproliferative disorder progressed to MDS, myelofibrosis) she is transfusion dependent for pRBC q1-2 wks, baseline Ht ___. Dr ___ is heme/oncologist. Recent admission for hyperkalemia at transfusion clinic last week. Next transfusion ___.

#diastolic CHF: Mild LV systolic dysfunction. Last TTE ___. Not  decompensated on exam or symptomatic. Her BB was discontinued at discharge because of fatigue and inappropriate HR response to exertion. Her lasix was continued. 

#HTN: BPs in the ER fluctuated from systolic ___ to 140s, increased from ___ to 120s after 500mL IV bolus. She was normotensive and was not orthostatic the morning after admission. Her hydralazine was initially held but restarted on discharge. Metoprolol was held on discharge after discussing with her cardiologist (Dr. ___.

#CKD: Stage 3. Cr 1.9 at baseline, 1.9-2. 

#AF: in NSR. Continued home amiodarone, metoprolol. Not on anticoagulation given underlying MDS/MPN. On discharge her home metoprolol was discontinued given her fatigue and inappropriate HR response to standing/work.

#GERD: continued ppi. 

#Asthma: continued home inhalers  #HLD: home fibrate and statin

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: #ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION #NEPRHOLITHIASIS #MYELOPROLIFERATIVE MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.  Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___, you were admitted with for an episode of loss of consciousness. We think that this was related to dehydration after not drinking on the day of admission, pain medications you received in the ER, and your home blood pressure medications. Your blood pressure improved with IV fluid in the ER and you had no symptoms of a seizure. When we rechecked your BP the next morning you did not have a drop with standing. When physical therapy saw you, they felt that you were safe to go home. 

MEDICATION CHANGES: -We recommend that you do not take the prescription medication tamsulosin that you received in the ER yesterday as this can lower blood pressure even more. It will likely only help speed up the passage of the kidney stone by a little bit and we believe the risks outweigh the benefits. Also, please stop taking your metoprolol as it may predispose you to feel light headed or pass out. OTHERWISE YOUR MEDICATIONS ARE THE SAME

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.  Followup Instructions: ___
