There is a grade 1 anterolisthesis of C7 on T1, which is likely related to degenerative disease, and was a similar appearance on ___. The spinal canal appears patent without evidence of an epidural hematoma. Visualized lung apices reveal no pneumothorax.   IMPRESSION: 1.

___ yo woman with cva, htn, depression, osteoporosis who presents after fall with C4 fracture and recent confusion/failure to thrive.   # Depression: Pt has failed multiple medications "25" without relief, and 5 psychiatrists.

Pt has severe depression by symptoms - including increased sleep, no energy, has no motivation to get out of bed, has difficulty motivating herself to cook or clean, has nothing in her life she looks forward to with any joy, has strong feelings of guilt, difficulty concentrating. Psychiatry recommended consultation by an ECT specialist who believes the patient is a good canidate for ECT. They also recommended that the patient be weaned from her BZ and her clonazepam was changed to shorter acting ativan which was tapered. Her PCP also recommended discontinuing her BB and her metop was transitioned to dilt 240mg. Ortho cleared the patient for ECT and did not believe the C4 spinous process fx was such that it would cause any joint instability. . # Confusion/failure to thrive: organic causes unlikely with normal WBC, UA, not dehydrated, not hypothyroid, lytes normal. No B12 defic, TSH high, but FT4 normal, valproate normal, CT head normal - no NPH, and pt stopped taking abilify 1wk ago, not contrib. Likely pseudodementia from severe prolonged depression, but pt may have some underlying dementia component also. Mental status improved rapidly during her hospital stay.

Pt's CT head was negative for bleed. ortho ___ collar continuously, but cleared by ortho for activity as tolerated with c-collar. Ortho cleared pt for ECT as the fracture did not cause destabalization of the joint. ___ cleared pt for fall risk. .  # Hypertension: metoprolol discontinued during hospitalization due to concern of contribution to depression and diltiazem uptitrated.
