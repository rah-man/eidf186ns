               **FINAL REPORT ___

  C. difficile PCR (Final ___:    Reported to and read back by ___ ON ___ AT 3PM.    POSITIVE.       (Reference Range-Negative).      The C. difficile PCR is highly sensitive for toxigenic strains of     C. difficile and detects both C. difficile infection (CDI) and     asymptomatic carriage. Therefore, positive C. diff PCR tests     trigger reflex C. difficile toxin testing, which is highly     specific for CDI. 

  C. difficile Toxin antigen assay (Final ___:    POSITIVE.       (Reference Range-Negative).  PERFORMED BY EIA.      This result indicates a high likelihood of C. difficile infection     (CDI). __________________________________________________________ ___ 6:17 am BLOOD CULTURE   Source: Line-dialysis #1.

She was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia. 

She developed chest pressure consistent with angina on ___ following dialysis. She was noted to have troponin leak and ECG was unchanged from prior, consistent with demand NSTEMI. SL Nitro and IV morphine were given with improvement in pain. In the evening of ___, she complained of generalized body pain and was given Tylenol.

On the evening of ___, nursing staff found the patient to be unresponsive. MD was called to bedside. On exam, pulses could not be appreciated, and heartbeat and respirations were absent.

Did not have morning anti-anginal medications prior to HD, so these were administered, and chest pain resolved throughout the day. Trop leak thought most likely ___ demand, given known underlying coronary disease, and given her chest pain occurred in the setting of HD.
