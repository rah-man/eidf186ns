 Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: ======== ___ is a ___ year old man with metastatic gallbladder cancer on palliative FOLFIRI, who is admitted from the ED with abdominal pain with CT findings concerning for partial bowel obstruction and kinked biliary stent s/p duodenal stent placement with improvement in symptoms.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Metastatic gallbladder cancer # RUQ pain # Cancer associated pain # partial bowel obstruction # partial gastric outlet obstruction CT A/P at BID-N showed new infiltrative mass of gallbladder fossa extending into the anterior abdominal wall (new since the time of a PET in ___, gastric antrum with subsequent distension of proximal stomach, and tethering of the ascending colon with proximal dilation of large bowel and small bowel c/w partial obstruction. Following admission his pain was controlled with Tylenol and he was PO challenged. He had large volume emesis and ongoing abdominal pain and nausea suggestive of ongoing obstruction. NGT was placed and set to low intermittent suction, and was noted to be draining dark guaiac+ fluid, though he had no evidence of ongoing GIB, and Hgb was stable this admission. However bleeding precautions were followed including IV BID PPI, 2 PIVs, active T&S. Maintence crystalloids were given at 100cc/hr while NPO with prn boluses. His abdominal pain resolved. LFTs were monitored and remained within normal limits. He underwent upper endoscopy with duodenal stent placement on ___. His NGT was removed. His diet was advanced to a regular, low fiber diet, which he was instructed to continue following discharge.

# Constipation Per family report, he had not been taking his home bowel regimen regularly prior to admission. Aggressive non-stimulatory bowel regimen with miralax TID and docusate BID was given during this admission. He was given lactulose x1 on ___ and bisacodyl suppositories as needed. Opiates were avoided given constipation. Upon discharge, he was instructed to continue taking decussate BID, with Miralax PRN.

# Adrenal insufficiency Continued his home hydrocortisone 10mg qam; 5mg q 2pm; fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily. He was given stress dose hydrocortisone while NPO, which was tapered and discontinued prior to discharge. Due to low blood pressures, his home hydrocortisone doses were doubled. He was instructed to continue to take double his home steroid regimen upon going home.

# Anemia in malignancy # Thrombocytopenia Counts were noted to be dropping in the setting of chemotherapy, he was monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding and his counts were followed with daily CBC.

# Lupus anticoagulant # History of DVT His home apixiban 2.5 mg PO BID was held while he was NPO, especially given his low platelets and concern for GI bleeding giving dark emesis that was guaiac positive. He was transitioned to lovenox 40 mg SQH daily for DVT prophylaxis while NPO. Prior to discharge, his apixiban 2.5 BID was restarted without evidence of bleeding.

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # Hypothyroidism: his home levothyroxine was given IV while he was NPO, then was restarted as PO.

# Hypertension: Home lisinopril was initially held while NPO with low blood pressures, then restarted. However, his blood pressure remained lower than his baseline, possibly due to adrenal insufficiency and stress of acute illness, so his lisinopril was held at time of discharge.

# BPH: Flomax was held initially while NPO, then restarted.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] His outpatient providers should further titrate his bowel regimen medications. [] His home lisinopril was held on discharge due to hypotension. His outpatient providers should restart this medication if appropriate. [] He was instructed to double his dose of hydrocortisone until follow up with his PCP. If blood pressures stable, consider returning to his normal dose. [] The outpatient oncology team was in contact with his primary oncologist regarding his treatment regimen given the progression of disease noted on CT scan. He will follow up with his oncologist on ___ as previously scheduled.
