 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis s/p recent TAVR, CAD s/p DES currently on plavix, who presented from rehab with syncope of unclear origin.

#Syncope - various causes were considered for the patient's syncope/fall including cardiogenic causes, neurogenic causes, overdiuresis, poor PO intake, vagal episode, and/or anemia. An EP consult was obtained for advice regarding evaluation and management of syncope in the setting of presumed AV nodal disease and a recent TAVR. It was noted that, on her EKG, the patient has noticeable shortening of her PR interval compared to post-TAVR. She has had no evidence of second degree AV block on telemetry. Her bradycardic episode captured on tele showed sinus bradycardia with junctional escape. The patient denied any concerning symptoms to suggest that she has been having intermittent arrhythmia during the last several weeks. Additionally, conduction disease related to TAVR is most common immediately post-op and becomes more rare as time passes from the initial placement of the valve. An ECHO was additionally obtained which revealed a well seated Evolute aortic bioprosthesis with normal gradients and no rest/valsalva LVOT obstruction. Mild to moderate paravalvular leak. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Increased PCWP. Syncope thought to be likely multifactorial in nature, including low BP/HR upon wakening in early morning, increased vagal tone, and overdiuresis with Lasix. EP recommended having an event monitor at some point to capture recurrent syncopal episodes.

#Macrocytic anemia: Patient responded well to 2 units of pRBCs given on day of admission (HGB 7.5 on day of admission). CT abdomen and pelvis showed no e/o retroperitoneal or intramuscular bleed. Iron at 26, TIBC at 216, and ferritin at 296 which may indicate a component of anemia of chronic disease. Stool guaiac negative. Haptoglobin WNL. Patient remains asymptomatic without c/f active bleeding. Patient's last Hg level was stable at 8.8 on day of discharge. No e/o B12 or folate deficiency. 

# CKD: creatinine mildly elevated at 1.4 from 1.2 at time of discharge a couple of weeks ago. Thought to be likely ___ poor PO intake. Patient was not given IVF fluids during admission as Lasix was held i/s/o possible overdiuresis with recent episode of syncope and as patient had already received 2 units of pRBCs during her admission.

#Atrial fibrillation: Continued home warfarin dosing. INR 2.3 on admission and increased on home regimen to 3.7 on discharge. Unclear cause of acute increase as there were no change in meds. Possibly due to poor PO intake.

#CAD: s/p stenting in ___. Continued ASA 81, Plavix 75, atorvastatin 80. MetoprololXL 50mg was decreased to 25mg for HR in the 55-65 range

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #Restless leg: patient was continued on her home pramipexole 

#Hypothyroidism: patient was continued on her home Levothyroxine 

 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Discharge Weight 67.2 kg #Lasix held on discharge as she remained euvolemic off diuretics. Likely does not need diuretics anymore given AS has been corrected by TAVR. #INR 3.7 on discharge: Warfarin should be held on ___ and ___. Please check INR on ___ and start new regimen of 2mg daily. #Patient should follow up with her cardiologist in the next 2 weeks for consideration of an event monitor in the event that this was arrythmogenic syncope. #Metoprolol XL 50mg daily decreased to 25mg daily for borderline bradycardia. #Allopurinol ___ daily decreased to 100mg daily for chronic renal dysfunction.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ ___. During your stay with us, we evaluated you for your syncope and fall. We determined that your fall was unlikely due to an abnormal heart rhythm or structural heart abnormality. However, you should follow up with your cardiologist for consideration of a heart monitor that could capture any future syncopal episodes.

During your stay with us, we also found that you had a decreased red blood cell count. We performed a CT scan of your head, abdomen, and pelvis which showed no evidence of bleeding. We gave you a transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells which corrected your hemoglobin level. Your iron levels were low and ferritin level (body's iron stores) were elevated, indicating possible anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. Your vitamin B12 levels were elevated and your folate levels were normal. We recommend having ongoing follow up with your primary care doctor to check your hemoglobin levels regularly. 

If you experience any new or ongoing falls, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting, please return to the hospital for further care.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely, Your ___ Team
