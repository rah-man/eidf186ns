DISCHARGE LABS

___ 08:15AM BLOOD ___ ___ Plt ___ ___ 08:15AM BLOOD ___ ___  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ with Gold Stage IV COPD (FEV1 19% of predicted) on 2L of home O2, prostate CA, who presented with one week of malaise low grade fevers, productive cough and dyspnea on exertion, admitted for LUL pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  Active Issues: ======================== # LUL Pneumonia: Diagnosed patient with community acquired pneumonia based on clinical history and CXR. The patient has not been hospitalized in last ___ days and does not require treatment for HCAP at this time. Had an increased O2 requirement at home to 4LNC. Was at baseline O2 2L NC during hospitalization. Placed patient on 5 day course of azithromycin 250 mg PO daily (end date ___. Initially received ceftriaxone 1 gm IV and then transitioned to PO cefpodoxime 200 mg q12h for a total of 7 days (end date ___. Patient was discharged on 2L NC.  

# COPD Gold stage IV: Patient chronically on 2L NC at home. Had increased O2 requirement to 4L NC with dyspnea on exertion and increased sputum production. Treated patient with antibiotics for pneumonia as above. Placed patient on prednisone 30 mg daily x 4 days with taper. Continued home advair and theophylline continued as well as 2L O2. Placed on scheduled ipratropium and albuterol while inpatient. Ambulatory oxygenation saturation was in the ___ on 3L NC. Will discharge patient on home meds including antibiotics and prednisone taper.

# Reactive thrombocytosis: Has history of thrombocytosis. Admission platelets 949K. Discharge platelets 1114K. Most likely reactive in the setting of infection. ___ CBC at outpatient.

# Tachycardia: History of multifocal atrial tachycardia. HR ___ during admission. Patient received scheduled albuterol nebs. Also patient was hypovolemic as he was not taking adequate PO intake. Patient clinically improved on antibiotic regimen and thus tachycardia was not thought to be due to worsening infection. Oxygen requirement improved and had ___ probability for PE. HR increased to ___ with exercise. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no variation in P waves. Discharge HR ___.

# Atypical chest pain: Patient complained of chest pain on admission. Initially described the pain as tightness, worse with deep inspiration. Was unable to localize the pain as the location would change. Lung sounds were diminished throughout and initially attributed to COPD exacerbation. The morning of discharge, patient complained of substernal chest pain at rest that radiated to the back. Denied radiation to arm or neck, denied diaphoresis. Worse with breathing treatments. EKG was unchanged from prior EKG. Chest pain could be secondary to COPD exacerbation v. GERD. ACS unlikely, however can consider stress testing as outpatient given CAD risk factors. Patient was hemodynamically stable and chest pain resolved without interventions.   Chronic Issues: ==================================== # Hypertension: Pt continued on home mediations: valsartan and verapamil. # Depression: Pt continued on home medication: venlafaxine. 

Transitional Issues: ==================================== - ___ in ___ clinic at ___ - continue cefpodoxime until ___ - ___ pending blood cultures (___) - CBC at PCP visit - ___ chest pain symptoms and consider outpatient stress testing given risk factors for CAD
