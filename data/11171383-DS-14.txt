CT abd/pelvis ___ ___  EXAM#   TYPE/EXAM            RESULT            ___ CT/CT ABD & PEL ___/                          ___       ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:       CLINICAL HISTORY: ___ woman with history of lumpectomy, now   with abdominal pain with constipation. Evaluate for small bowel   obstruction.       COMPARISON: None available.       TECHNIQUE: Axial multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis   were obtained after administration of oral and intravenous contrast   with sagittal and coronal reformatted images.        TOTAL EXAM DLP: ___.___ mGy-cm.        FINDINGS:        CT ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is   mild dependent atelectasis at the visualized lung bases, right greater   than left. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. The visualized   portion of the heart is enlarged, and mitral valve annulus is   calcified. There is a small hiatal hernia. Radiopaque contrast   within the hiatal hernia and visualized distal esophagus suggests   gastroesophageal reflux, at least in supine position.        There is a large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis.    There appears to be focal omental nodularity in the left upper   quadrant on image 3:39 where the contour is irregular. No focal liver   lesions are seen. The spleen is not enlarged. The splenic and   portal veins, as well as the superior mesenteric vein, are patent and   not enlarged. No clear gastroesophageal, splenorenal, or recanalized   periumbilical varices are identified.        Mild gallbladder wall edema is likely related to the ascites. There   is no biliary or pancreatic ductal dilatation. No focal pancreatic   lesions are detected. Bilateral adrenal nodules are detected,   difficult to measure accurately due to isoenhancement relative to the   adrenal parenchyma, but measuring approximately 18 x 12 mm on the   right, image 3:26, and 18 x 10 mm on the left, image 3:28.  The   kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically without hydronephrosis,   ureteral dilatation, or focal lesions. The aorta is normal in   caliber.    Orally administered contrast reaches the sigmoid colon without   obstruction. No bowel wall thickening is seen. No enlarged mesenteric   or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.       CT PELVIS: There is a large amount of ascites in the pelvis.    Peritoneal nodularity along the pelvic side walls may be present,   image 3:73. The uterus is small with multiple calcifications, likely   calcified fibroids. No adnexal masses are visualized. The bladder is   not distended. The rectum is unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes   are identified.        There is diffuse anasarca in the visualized subcutaneous soft tissues.       CT BONES: The bones are demineralized. There is severe compression   of the L2 vertebral body with retropulsion, resulting in severe spinal   canal narrowing. There is grade I anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, likely   related to right greater than left facet arthropathy.  There is also   minimal anterolisthesis of L3 on L4, likely also related to bilateral   facet arthropathy. There are two internal fixation screws in the left   femoral neck related to a chronic healed fracture.        IMPRESSION:       1.  LARGE ABDOMINAL/PELVIC ASCITES AND SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL      EFFUSIONS.        2.  POSSIBLE PERITONEAL NODULARITY ALONG BILATERAL PELVIC SIDE WALLS      AND POSSIBLE FOCAL OMENTAL CAKING IN THE LEFT UPPER QUADRANT,      CONCERNING FOR PERITONEAL CARCINOMATOSIS.        3.  IRREGULAR LIVER CONTOUR MAY INDICATE CIRRHOSIS.  HOWEVER, THERE      IS NO SPLENOMEGALY, ENLARGEMENT OF THE PORTAL OR SPLENIC VEINS,      OR CLEAR EVIDENCE FOR VARICES TO INDICATE PORTAL HYPERTENSION AS      THE BASIS FOR ASCITES.        4.  INDETERMINATE SMALL BILATERAL ADRENAL NODULES. PRIOR STUDIES      COULD HELP DETERMINE WHETHER THESE ARE STABLE ADRENAL ADENOMAS OR      NEW METASTATIC LESIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR STUDIES,      NONCONTRAST CT OR MULTIPHASIC MRI COULD BE OBTAINED, IF      CLINICALLY INDICATED.     5.  SMALL UTERUS WITH CALCIFIED FIBROIDS. NO EVIDENCE FOR ADNEXAL      MASSES.       6.  COMPLETE COMPRESSION OF L2 VERTEBRAL BODY WITH RETROPULSION AND      SEVERE SPINAL CANAL NARROWING, WHICH MAY BE BETTER ASSESSED BY      LUMBAR SPINE MRI, IF CLINICALLY WARRANTED.

==================================       Procedures ================================== PARACENTESIS DIAG/THERAP W IMAGING GUIDStudy Date of ___ 1:04 ___

Final Report EXAMINATION: Ultrasound-guided paracentesis.  INDICATION: ___ year old woman with new ascites, suspect carcinomatosis // therapeutic para  TECHNIQUE: Ultrasound guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis  COMPARISON: Comparison is made to CT abdomen pelvis dated ___.  FINDINGS:  Limited grayscale ultrasound imaging of the abdomen demonstrated a large amount of ascites. A suitable target in the deepest pocket in the left lowerquadrant was selected for paracentesis.  PROCEDURE: The procedure, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with the patient and written informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure time-out was performed discussing the planned procedure, confirming the patient's identity with 3 identifiers, and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ catheter was advanced into the largest fluid pocket in the left lower quadrant and 4.1 L of clear, straw-coloredfluid was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication. Estimated blood loss was minimal.  Dr. ___ attending radiologist, was present throughout the critical portions of the procedure.  IMPRESSION:  Uneventful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding 4.1 L of clear, straw-colored ascitic fluid.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with constipation and abdominal distention, found to have new ascites, imaging with peritoneal carcinomatosis. her hospital course is detailed by problem below.

# Ascites/new cancer diagnosis: For her ascites she had diagnostic paracentesis on ___ and a therapeutic paracentesis on ___. Labwork showed elevated CA-125. CT showed omental nodularity and bilateral adrenal nodules. There were no adnexal masses. There were no stigmata of cirrhosis on exam. Patient also has normal platelets and synthetic function. Contributing factors from heart failure could be considered given systolic murmur and cardiomegaly. She had an echo showing severe aortic stenosis and an elevated BNP. She was initially started on lasix but this was stopped prior to discharge because she was having trouble with urinary incontinence overnight. No evidence of SBP based on ascitic PMN.

Cytology from paracentesis showed adenocarcinoma, with IHC markers suggesting gynecologic origin. We had multiple conversations with patient over the next 3 days regarding her goals of care. She stated consistently that with her current quality of life (reduced mobility, having to depend on caregivers ___, unable to use bathroom independently) she is not interested in prolonging her life with cancer directed therapies. We discussed non chemotherapy options such as hormonal treatment which may help control cancer and associated symptoms. Again she was not interested in these treatments. If she changes her mind or wants to discuss further, a gynecologic oncologist would be appropriate. Here at ___ she can contact Dr. ___. We discussed that going forward the fluid in her abdomen may reaccumulate, and that at this point it is difficult to tell how quickly. If her belly becomes tense and uncomfortable again, she will need repeat paracentesis, and at that time we could consider abdominal pleurx for palliation if frequent paracentesis is expected. Her case was discussed, at her request, with ___ and ___. She is fully competent to make medical decisions and they were supportive of her decisions. 

We also discussed the possibility of a genetic component. she is of ___ background and has several relatives with cancer. She reports she had no biological children and that there are no relatives that might benefit from testing (many family members were killed in the ___).    # Hyponatremia: Subacute presentation, normal sodium until ___, most likely SIADH in the setting of malignancy. Patient clinically is volume overloaded. Echo with severe AS and elevated BNP on bloodwork. Heart failure may be contributing as well. She was put on fluid restriction with stabilization of her sodium around 130. She had no symptoms so no further measures were needed. TSH, free cortisol were unremarkable

# spinal canal narrowing on CT: she had no associated symptoms of new leg numbness or weakness, so MRI for further characterization was not pursued. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, her losartan and pravastatin were discontinued as they are unlikely to be of benefit. Her BP has remained in the low 100s systolic.

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: malignant ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis, likely ovarian cancer  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.  Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ ___. You were admitted for buildup of fluid in your belly. This was found to be related to cancer. You had the fluid drawn out and feel much better afterward. Analysis of the fluid shows that this is most likely ovarian cancer, though breast cancer is a possibility as well. We talked about treatments, including hormonal treatments, which might prolong your life or palliate symptoms. You indicated to us several times that you are not enjoying your quality of life due to reduced mobility, and that you are not interested in any treatments to control the cancer. You will be discharged to rehab to continue working on physical therapy. If you develop abdominal fluid again, or other symptoms, the doctor at rehab will assess and decide whether you need to come back to the hospital. If you change your mind about treatment and decide that you would like to speak to an oncologist, information is provided below. Take care!  Followup Instructions: ___
