 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of mild dementia, CAD per OMR but no records in our system, CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.7), HTN, HLD, BPH s/p prostatectomy, GERD and other issues who presents with chest pain. The patient's daughter provides much of the history through an interpreter. Aprroximately 1 month ago, the patient had a severe episode of chest pain that he described as substernal and pressure-like and which occurred at rest. It was not associated with SOB, nausea, diaphoresis, or palpitations. He had previously experienced similar pain but of much less intensity. Since the severe episode 1 month ago, he has continued to have occasional ___ per week) episodes of substernal chest discomfort that radiates to his neck and that he describes as a burning sensation. He most recently experienced this ___ days ago. He went to his PCP's office today, where an ECG was performed that reportedly showed a new T-wave inversion in V3; he was subsequently sent to the ED for further evaluation.  On arrival in the ED, the patient did not have chest pain and felt well. In the ED intial vitals were: 98.0 78 131/49 18 100% RA.

STUDIES: ___ ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.  

___ CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of mild dementia, CAD (per OMR but no records in our system and pt and family deny), CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.7), HTN, HLD, BPH s/p prostatectomy, GERD and other issues who presents with remote chest pain, EKG changes, and troponinemia concerning for NSTEMI.  # Chest pain concerning for NSTEMI: Given that the patient experienced pain at maximal intensity a month ago with only intermittent mild pain since, it is likely that the patient had a completed event. It is unclear if his troponinemia represents ongoing ischemia or simply reflects recent ischemia given his CKD; this is supported by his normal CK-MB. However, with a completed event we would expect to see Q-waves on ECG by now, which are not present. S/p full-dose aspirin in ED, heparin gtt was not started. Daughter and patient state that patient has not had an MI and never a stent. TTE without wall motion abnormality. Patient has been chest pain free during admission. Was monitored on telemetry without event. Held home nitroglycerin patch. Continued home Rosuvastatin and aspirin. Unable to start ACEI given hypotension. He was started on low dose metoprolol on ___ and transitioned to 12.5mg metop succ XL. Will follow up with Dr. ___ as outpatient.

# Anemia: Stable from recent baseline of ___ (Hgb 10.9 at that time). His chest pain does not likely represent symptomatic anemia given that his anemia is relatively mild and longstanding. Held home iron supplement given nonformulary, resumed at discharge  # CKD: Cr 1.5 on admission, compatible with recent baseline of 1.4-1.7. 

# Dementia: Held home memantine and rivastigmine given non-formulary. Continued home donepezil  

# Vertigo / BPPV: Held home meclizine while inpatient  # GERD: Continued home omeprazole, ranitidine, and calcium carbonate  # BPH: Held home dutasteride for now given non-formulary, resumed on discharge 

# Pain: Continued Gabapentin, topical diclofenac, and topical lidocaine 

# Constipation: Continued aggressive home bowel reg with lactulose, senna, colace, bisacodyl 

# CODE: full (confirmed)  # CONTACT: Patient, HCP ___ (daughter) ___, son-in-law ___ is alternate ___

# Transitional issues:  - Consider discontinuing Ibuprofen given CKD  - Consider discontinuing meclizine to reduce polypharmacy and limited efficacy - If recurrent chest pain would consider cardiac cath if within goals of care   Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with chest pain and was found to have a small heart attack. An echocardiogram of your heart was performed and it showed normal functioning. Given that your chest pain resolved on its own and you are at fairly high risk for a procedure, cardiac catheterization was felt not to be the best option at present and you were treated with medicines. Should you have chest pain in the future, you will likely need a cardiac catheterization at that point.  Followup Instructions: ___
