STUDIES TTE ___ CONCLUSION: The left atrium is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular function. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is >=50%. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve is not well seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Very poor image quality. Normal biventricular wall thicknesses, cavity sizes, and global systolic function. MIld mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , apical dysfunction is not suggested on the current study, but image quality is very poor. RECOMMEND: If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR or MUGA scan is suggested for further evaluation of regional/global systolic function. Cardiac MR with gadolinium would also allow for assessment for prior infarction.

___ Coronary Catheterization Coronary Description The coronary circulation is right dominant. LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large caliber vessel with p[reviously deployed stents extneding into proximal LAD. This vessel bifurcates into the Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems. There is a 30% in-stent restenosis in the proximal, mid, and distal segments. LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 50% stenosis in the proximal segment within previously deployed stents. There is a 100% stenosis in the mid segment. The Septal Perforator, arising from the mid segment, is a small caliber vessel. The Diagonal, arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber vessel. Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 100% stenosis in the proximal segment. The Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber vessel. RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is a small caliber vessel. There is an 80% diffuse stenosis in the mid segment. There is an 80% stenosis in the distal segment. The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. SVG to OM1 is widely patent. SVG to PDA has 30% stenosis in proximal segment at bendpoint in the vessel. Complications: There were no clinically significant complications.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure participating in your care. Please read through the following information.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest pain. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL? While you were here, we did blood tests which showed you had a heart attack. You underwent a procedure to have the arteries of your heart looked at. None of the arteries had a clear blockage, so we did not put in any stents. You were treated you with medications to help prevent blockages from developing (Aspirin and Plavix). 

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below)  - Follow up with your doctors as listed below  - Weigh yourself every morning. Your weight on discharge is 161 lb. Please seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs (increases to a weight of 164). - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night.   We wish you the best!
