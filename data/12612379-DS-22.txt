STUDIES ============= EKG ___ Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no change

CXR ___ IMPRESSION: On background of chronic lung changes including emphysema, bronchiectasis and atelectasis, there is new pulmonary edema with new small bilateral pleural effusions. Opacifications projecting over right upper lung are less conspicuous compared to ___ and may be due to atelectasis or resolving pneumonia.

CXR ___ FINDINGS: On a background of emphysema, there has been interval improvement of the previously noted moderate pulmonary edema with minimal evidence of bronchial cuffing and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged compared to the prior exam. Scarring and volume loss in the right middle lobe appear stable. Again seen is a large irregular density projecting over the right lower lung, which corresponds to a large unusual branching calcification as characterized by a prior CT. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION:  1. Interval improvement of moderate pulmonary edema, with residual mild pulmonary edema. 2. Overall, minimal interval change in the small bilateral pleural effusions.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of COPD, prior ___, recent admission for COPD exacerbation and AFib with RVR presenting with shortness of breath and concern for volume overload 

# Acute diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient presented with shortness of breath, increasing oxygen demand, and lower extremity edema. She was found to be volume overloaded likely from acute diastolic congestive heart failure. She was diuresed with IV lasix and her symptoms improved.
