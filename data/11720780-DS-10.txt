PATHOLOGY

CSF CYTOLOGY ___: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS

IMMUNOTYPING CSF ___: RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. Due to paucicellular nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality. B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality. T cells comprise 97% of lymphoid gated events.  INTERPRETATION Non-diagnostic study. Clonality could not be assessed in this case due to insufficient numbers of B cells. Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells. If clinically indicated, we recommend a repeat specimen be submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory. 

BONE MARROW ___ CELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH MILD TRILINEAGE DYSPOIESIS AND NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LARGE CEL LYMPHOMA.   Note: The possibility of a myelodysplastic syndrome needs to be entertained in this patient with history of therapy with R-EPOCH. Please correlate with clinical and cytogenetic findings.  

 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION peripheral blood smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes are normochromic, and normocytic and have marked anisopoikilocytosis including elliptocytes and spherocytes, echinocytes, polychromatophils, and nucleated RBC are seen. The white blood cell count is normal with left shifted maturation. Neutrophils exhibit toxic vacuolization, hypogranulation and rarely, hypolobation. The platelet count appears normal. Occasional large and giant platelets are seen. A 200 cell differential shows: 78% neutrophils, 1% bands, 17% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes.  aspirate smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of multiple cellular spicules. The M:E ratio is 1.1: 1. Erythroid precursors are relatively increased in number and have megaloblastoid and dyspoietic maturation, including cells with irregular satellite nuclei, and nuclear cytoplasmic dyssynchrony. Myeloid precursors are relatively decreased in number and show mildly dyspoietic maturation, including rare hypolobated cells. Megakaryocytes are normal in number.  Abnormal forms are seen including rare hypolobated cells. Foci of increased stripped nuclei are present. Scattered histiocytes with ingested cellular debris are also seen.  A 500 cell differential shows: 1% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 11% myelocytes, 4% metamyelocytes, 33% bands/neutrophils, 38% erythroids, 9% lymphocytes, 1% plasma cells.  clot section and biopsy slides: The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation. It consists of a fragmented, in total 1 cm core biopsy of trabecular marrow with a variable cellularity of ___. The M:E ratio estimate is normal. Erythroid precursors are normal in number, and have overall normoblastic maturation. Myeloid precursors are normal in number, with normal maturation.  Megakaryocytes are normal in number with focal loose clustering.  

CSF IMMUNOPHENOTYPING ___: RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. Due to paucicellular nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality. B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality. INTERPRETATION Non-diagnostic study. Clonality could not be assessed in this case due to insufficient number cells. Cell marker analysis was attempted but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells. If clinically indicated, we recommend a repeat specimen be submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory.

BM IMMUNOPHENOTYPING ___:

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: ___, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3,5,10,19,20,23 and 45. CD45 bright, low side scatter lymphocytes represent ~7% of total events. B cells comprise <1% of lymphoid-gated events. T cells comprise 94% of lymphoid gated events. INTERPRETATION Nonspecific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see ___ is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

BM CYTOLOLGY ___: ATYPICAL.  Large atypical lymphocytes. Further classification is not possible. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman status post treatment for a B-cell lymphoma with new ___ lesions concerning for CNS recurrence.

ACUTE # CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma now with CNS Recurrence: s/p five cycles of R-EPOCH and scheduled to receive Rituxan every three months as maintenance therapy. Pt initially presented to ___ with encephalopathy at which time periventricular ___ lesions were identified with cerebral edema. There was no focal e/o neurological compromise. She was transferred here for further management where she was started on dexamethasone q6hrs.  Bone marrow showed no e/o involvement and CT of the torso showed no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. LP was performed and results were somewhat equivical, demonstrating atypical lymphocytes. PCR for a B-cell receptor rearrangement was also somewhat equivocal. Clonality could not be accessed by immunophenotyping. Gram stain and culture were negative. Toxo was negative. In discussion with family, it was felt that the likelihood of this being CNS recurrence of lymphoma was high.  Empiric radiation therapy and high dose methotrexate were discussed. ___ biopsy was deferred given high likelihood to represent lymphoma. Pt was started on high dose methotrexate once sufficient alkalinization of urine was achieved. Renal function was closely monitored. Levels were monitored and she was discharged once MTX levels were <0.1. Followup was arranged with Dr. ___ further course of MTX and rituxan will be discussed at that time. Prior to discharge, dexamethasone was weened to once daily dosing. Discharged on bactrim and acyclovir ppx.

# Bacteuria: In the setting of mild confusion and pending immunosuppression, pt was initially started on cipro on admission. Culture however showed enterococcus only sensitive to ampicillin, macrobid, and vancomycin. Pt was transitioned to vancomycin and then macrobid for a total of ___iarrhea: concern for C diff initially, though testing was negative. Resolved with discontinuation of abx.

CHRONIC # Pulmonary embolus: Found incidentally on ___. Started on lovenox which discontinued on ___. Her CT at that time showed chronic PE which was not completely resolved. Full-dose anticoagulation was held during this admission.

# GERD: Pt was continued on PPI 

TRANSITIONAL # maintenance rituxan # continue discussions for repeat MTX dose if tolerating well # determine appropriate steroid course
