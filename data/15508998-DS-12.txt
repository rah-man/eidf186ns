IMAGING ======= ___ CT A/P 1. No evidence of active bleeding on the current scan. Patent splanchnic branches. 2. Long segment colitis of the descending colon, given the distribution ischemic colitis is the most probable etiology. 3. Multiple pancreatic cystic lesions, which may represent side-branch intra ductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms. 4. Probable segmental portal venous thrombosis versus focally dilated bile duct within the posterior right hepatic lobe. 5. Indeterminate hepatic hypodensities, most likely cysts or hamartomas.

___ Sigmoidoscopy: erythema, congestion, and friability in descending colon compatible with colitis. Moderate diverticulosis of sigmoid colon. Blood in descending colon and sigmoid colon.

PATHOLOGY ========== ___. Descending colon mucosal biopsy: Colonic mucosa with focal active inflammation and crypt atrophy; findings suggestive of ischemic changes

 Brief Hospital Course: PATIENT SUMMARY =============== ___ yo F with hx of HTN and colonic diverticulosis with multiple and recent lower GIBs requiring hospitalization at ___ who presented with bright red blood per rectum, CT without actively bleeding colonic diverticula, and nonspecific colitis; flex sig showed blood and diverticula though none actively bleeding, and some inflammatory changes. Hemodynamically stable, not transfused this admission. 

ACUTE ISSUES: ============= # Lower GI Bleed # Diverticulosis # Ischemic colitis She presented with BRBPR. She has had multiple hospitalizations for diverticular bleeds including ___ at ___. CT A/P on admission did not show any sites of active bleeding, and showed new colitis. Infectious and inflammatory colitis were considered. Most likely mild ischemic colitis from hypotension in the setting of her diverticular bleed. Flex sig ___ am showed blood and mild colitis, no actively bleeding diverticula. She had one small episode of bleeding after the flex sig, but her Hgb was stable. GI recommends that she be seen by ___ for embolization if she has another bleeding event because of the location of her diverticulosis. 

# Blood loss anemia Secondary to GI bleeds. Hgb stable at ___ this admission, asymptomatic. No transfusions this admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #HTN Her home amlodipine was held initially in the setting of GI bleed. This may be restarted if hypertensive when she sees her PCP. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] She will see GI for MRCP for pancreatic cysts found incidentally on CT A/P. [] If she rebleeds, she should go to ED for stat CT A/P and possible ___ intervention. [] Holding amlodipine given normotensive this admission and recent bleeding. Consider when to restart [] Anemia following multiple admissions for lower GI bleeds. Would repeat CBC.

CODE: Full CONTACT: ___ (friend) ___  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. amLODIPine 10 mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. HELD- amLODIPine 10 mg PO DAILY This medication was held. Do not restart amLODIPine until talking with your primary care doctor. Your blood pressure has been normal here, it often goes down when someone has had bleeding like you did.
