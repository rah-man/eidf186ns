RLE U/S: INDICATION: ___ male with chronic right lower extremity swelling.  Question thrombosis.   COMPARISON: None available.   FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler sonograms were performed of the right lower extremity, where there is significant subcutaneous soft tissue edema, limiting assessment of the calf veins. However there is normal compressibility, color flow, and augmentation in the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins, without evidence of DVT.   IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity. Limited calf vein assessment.   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

. Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable hypokinesis of the basal septum. There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Left ventricular dysnchrony is present. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with probable mild basal septal hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion due to wide QRS. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ___ surgery service on ___ and had a incarcerated spigelian hernia repair. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint until POD #4. On POD#4, patient triggered due to increased confusion and decreased BPs to ___. Patient was found to be in new onset Afib with RVR. Trop was sent and first set was negative. Echo was negative. Cardiology was consulted and felt patient would benefit from transfer to medicine. Patient started on diltiazem and converted to long-acting diltiazem upon discharge. Started on ASA 81 daily during stay despite CHADS2 given bleeding risk and low HCT.

Anemia: The patient has severe anemia that was stable during his stay. He is a ___ and does not take blood tranfusions. He will need to continue with outpatient workup and colonoscopy.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint until POD#4. With trigger episode, patient's O2 saturation decreased to the low ___, however this resolved with 2L NC.  Resolved on D/C.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on POD#1. Intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
