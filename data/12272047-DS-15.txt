 History of Present Illness: ___ is a ___ year old woman with low grade follicular lymphoma, currently on oxbinutuzumab admitted with several weeks of progressive shortness of breath and cough. Starting in mid ___, patient developed symptoms of severe coughing. She had associated rhinitis but no other significant symptoms. Her cough progressed to the point she developed marked right chest rib pain. She started a course of azithromycin on ___ and was seen in ___ clinic on ___. She appeared relatively well at the time and she was treated supportively with benzonatate. Despite the benzonatate and azithromycin, her cough and pain progressed significantly over the last week. She now has associated fatigue, and on day of admission it got to the point she 'couldn't move', so she presented to the ED. In the ED, initial VS were T 98.2, HR 82, BP 126/70. Pain intermittently rated between 0 and 10. She was initially noted to be in significant respiratory distress and placed on a NRB. Initial labs notable for Na 134, K 7.4 (hemolyzed, repeat 5.0), HCO3 22, Cr 0.6, lactate 1.8, ABG 7.49/___, WBC 9.1 (89%N). CXR showed RLL consdildation and pleural effusion c/w PNA. Patient was given duonebs x2, IV ketorolac, and 1g IV CTX, and tramadol prior to transfer for further management.  VS prior to transfer were HR 92, BP 101/48, RR 26, O2 96%2LNC. On arrival to the floor, patient reports severe paroxysms of cough with right sided chest pain and abdominal muscle soreness. Also with rhinitis. She denies frank shortness of breath, but note she has to 'pant' to prevent coughing fits and pain. No fevers or chills. No headaches. Did develop a sore in her mouth while taking azithromycin and also recently cracked a tooth. No N/V or frank abdominal pain. No diarrhea. No dysuria. No new leg pain or swelling.  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY - per Dr. ___ note in ___ HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a longstanding history of follicular lymphoma dating back to ___. She was initially treated with Rituxan along with fludarabine which was then followed by CVP with Zevalin given in ___. She continued on maintenance rituximab until ___. In ___, she began showing circulating lymphocytes and increasing LDH with concern for a poor response to Rituxan and she subsequently then received treatment with bendamustine in ___ and completed three cycles of treatment as of ___. Her treatment was put on hold as she was dealing with issues around squamous cell carcinoma. She has received Rituxan periodically since that time when she was noted for increasing LDH and atypical cells. Her last treatment with Rituxan was in ___. Starting in ___, Ms. ___ was noted for increasing nodes in the left neck adenopathy. Imaging was done, which showed increased adenopathy within the neck area with a large left cervical rim-enhancing collection noted, with additional large necrotic cervical lymph nodes throughout the left cervical chain. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed supraclavicular and axillary lymphadenopathy, which had not changed significantly as well as some small retroperitoneal adenopathy and inguinal adenopathy, which had remained relatively stable. Because of the concern for infection vs. transformation of her lymphoma in the neck area, she was sent to the emergency room where attempts at a fine needle aspirate were done. Unfortunately, this was a nondiagnostic procedure and she subsequently underwent a core needle biopsy after being admitted. Review of biopsy results showed a concern for transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma within this lymph node, although it was not an ideal specimen with some crush artifacts. The Ki-67% was lower than that was expected based on the appearance of the lymphocytes in this specimen. It is felt to be better characterized as aggressive lymphoma; cytogenetics could not be run on the specimen. Ms. ___ decided to pursue treatment with Obinutuzumab. Ideally, we would include Bendamustine with this treatment, but she remains concerned about other side effects including hair loss. She underwent C1D1 obinutuzumab on ___ with C1D2 on ___. C1D8 was held on ___. She received XRT to the left neck and supraclavicular area. This completed on ___. - ___ C2 Obinutuzumab - ___ C3 Obinutuzumab - ___ C4 Obinutuzumab - ___ C5 Obinutuzumab PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Follicular lymphoma, as above - Remote history of pericarditis  Social History: ___ Family History: Her sister has a history of HTN but no other reported chronic diseases. No known family history of malignancy.  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.3 BP 102/66 HR 81 RR 18 O2 99%RA General: NAD HEENT: EOMI, MMM, neck supple CV: RRR Lungs: Decreased breath sounds. Chest Tube site with mild tenderness to palpation, no erythema. Abdomen: Soft NT ND Extremities: No edema Neuro: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Multifocal pneumonia. Moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion, and while there is no pleural enhancement which could be from immunocompromised state, empyema could have this appearance and should be excluded. 3. Small enhancing mediastinal lymph and hilar nodes are probably reactive. 4. Component of right basilar atelectasis. Significant mucous plugging right base. 5. Moderate calcified coronary atherosclerosis. 6. Probably moderate central canal narrowing lower thoracic spine with calcified disc protrusion. Chest CT ___: Multifocal and consolidations improved in the right lower lobe. Decrease in size in small right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion has minimally increased. Coronary calcifications Chest X-ray ___: 1. Small right basilar pneumothorax with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged following chest tube removal. 2. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman with low grade follicular lymphoma, currently on oxbinutuzumab who was admitted with several weeks of progressive shortness of breath and cough.
