ACTIVE ISSUES ============= #) FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA- Patient presented with fevers, cough productive of yellow-white phlegm, clear rhinorrhea, fever of 101.3 measured at home, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 580 upon admission. Exam of oropharynx was unremarkable without evidence of mucositis. No source of infection was identified as patient had negative blood cultures, urinalysis was unremarkable, and chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia. Patient symptomatically improved and remained afebrile off antibiotics. Patient had recovery of ANC during admission. Empirically treated with cefepime but discontinued prior to discharge. Symptoms clinically consistent with viral upper respiratory infection.

#) Stage III Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. Patient recently completed course of neoadjuvant ___ and radiation therapy with course prior to hospitalization. Throat discomfort was most likely due to his recent radiation therapy. He is to follow up with his outpatient oncologist regarding further management.

#) PANCYTOPENIA. Patient presented with pancytopenia. He tolerated 2 units of packed red blood cell transfusion well. Patient's white blood cells (including absolute neurtrophil count) and platelets improved without need for additional transfusions or agents.

#) HYPONATREMIA: Patient's serum sodium was 129 on admission, however he was asymptomatic. Serum sodium improved after administration of IV fluids. Most likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in setting of decreased oral intake. 

CHRONIC ISSUES ============= # Severe malnutrition. Patient received twice daily J tube flushes and Ensure supplements with meals. Plan to possibly initiate tube feeds as an outpatient.

#HTN- Patient's home amlodipine was held in setting of suspected infection and remained normotensive.
