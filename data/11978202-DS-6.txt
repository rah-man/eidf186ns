She remained afebrile and without leukocytosis; she will follow up with her PCP and rheumatologist.

# Bacteremia: from Klebsiella pneumo UTI Lactate WNL, no hemodynamic instability to support septic physiology. Pt at increased risk for infx given that she is on multiple immunosuppressive medications for her vasculitis.  -She received meropenem in the ER, which was switched to Cefepime after Sensitivities returned. She was treated for 3 days with IV antibiotics and then she was sent home on PO Cefpodoxime x11 days (total antibiotic Rx 14 days) .  # New L-sided weakness for the past week: Left arm and leg, was concerning for stroke. Also with LUE pain which could be contributing. Dry head CT negative. -Neuro consult: no evidence of stroke; likely limited mobility secondary to pain. .  # Elevated creatinine: at baseline throughout the admission. Meds were renally dosed. .  # Anemia: Macrocytic and Microcytic - Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic disease, and also patient found to be B12 deficient (186) and folate deficient -Patient started on B12, folate -was transfused 1 unit prior to d/c because of hct 23.3 considering cardiac history - homocysteine and MMA levels are pending at the time of discharge .  # Vasculitis: on immunosupressants. Pulm status currently stable, however crackles likely ___ chronic lung disease. Per rheumatology, she was continued on prednisone at 15 mg q day, methotrexate/leukovorin were held. She was continued on bactrim prophylaxis while in house. She was discharged on the above regimen until follow up with rheum as an outpatient. .  # Hx hypertension: resonably controlled this admission.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: urinary tract infection / bacteremia  Discharge Condition: Patient is being discharged to her home; she is ambulating without difficulty and she is alert/oriented.

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because blood drawn at your outpatient Rheumatology appointment came back positive for bacteria. You had a urinary tract infection, and the bacteria from there went into your bloodstream. We treated you with intravenous antibiotics for a few days, and when you improved we sent you home with 11 days of oral antibiotics. You also received one unit of blood to help with your chronic anemia.

***It is VERY important that you take ALL the antibiotic Cefpodoxime pills (until they are finished) even if you feel better.

In addition, we started new vitamins, folate and Vitamin B12, because your levels were low.

Please follow up with your PCP and rheumatologist.

The following changes were made to your medications: -Started cefpodoxime for your infection (11 more days) -Vitmain B12 and folate were started for your vitamin defiencies -Your Prednisone was kept at 15mg -Please stop taking the Methotrexate and Leucovorin until follow up with your Rheumatologist  Followup Instructions: ___
