============================ Procedure Report ___: TransSEPTAL transcatheter MITRAL valve repair Anesthesia: GA Blood loss: <10 ml Devices Used: Mitraclip XTR

Vascular access was obtained in the right femoral vein using vascular ultrasound techniques. RHC and LHC performed by transeptal approach and showed giant v waves up to 50 mmHg Transeptal Puncture was done Using Lamp 45 and needle under fluoro and TEE guidance to ensure 4 cm clearance from annulus 

The Mitraclip was advanced through the guide and positioned across A2 and P2 under fluoro and TEE guidance. First Grab resulted in reduction in MR to 1+, and great hemodynamics. and gradient of <5 mmHg

There was no evidence of complications following the procedure. =========================== TTE ___: The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right atrium is moderately enlarged. There is a secundum atrial septal defect. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a moderately increased/dilated cavity. There is moderate-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 32 %. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. A MitraClip prosthesis is present. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior TEE (images reviewed) of ___ , MitraClip now present. Mitral regurgitation is markedly reduced.

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for your mitral valve clip procedure. By repairing the valve your heart can pump blood more easily and your shortness of breath should improve. 

It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. In particular, you are now taking aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix). These medications help to prevent blood clots from forming in/around the heart valve. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming on your heart valve. This could cause it to malfunction and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking aspirin or Plavix without taking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications. 

You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental procedure. Please inform your dentist about your recent cardiac procedure. One hour prior to your dental procedure take amoxicillin 2 gram once. 

Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 75.7 kg/167 lb

We have made changes to your medication list, so please make sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary care doctor. 

If you have any urgent questions that are related to your recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at ___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse practitioner.
