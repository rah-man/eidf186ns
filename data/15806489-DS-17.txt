Coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. The remainder of her ___ hospital course was uneventful and she was cleared for surgery.

She was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent aortic valve replacement along with replacement of her ascending aorta and total arch. Please see operative note for full details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   She weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on POD 1. She was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and she was diuresed toward her preoperative weight. She remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She converted to normal sinus rhythm after Amiodarone, uptitration of beta blocker and repletion of electrolytes. Anti-coagulation is not initiated due to the brevity of AFib. Occupational therapy was consulted for right hand weakness. She was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 5 she was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. She was discharged home with ___ in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
