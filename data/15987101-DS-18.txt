Since undergoing the aforementioned colonoscopies, Mrs. ___ had not had any difficulties with diet, or had any episodes of nausea, vomiting, or decreased output per ostomy. She did endorse, however, persistent rectal pain in the setting of new-onset oozing from her rectum (dark brown fluid) and change in ostomy output (thinner, more green-brown than prior).

___ XRay Abdomen: Moderate amount of stool in the colon.  Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. ___ XRay Abdomen: There is fecal material in the transverse left colon and sigmoid colon. There is air in the rectum.  There is no evidence of obstruction. There are moderate-to-severe degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  There is mild left scoliosis. 

___ Pathology Examination of Ileostomy specimen: Two fragments of bowel measuring 5.6 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm and 2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm respectively. There is an external cauterized surface and internal mucosa that appears unremarkable. Skin and subcutaneous tissue, and small intestinal segment with changes of ileostomy site.

___ Pathology Examination of RLE Soft Tissue Specimen: The first piece measures 1.9 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm and the second measures 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. Nodular fat necrosis, suggestive of piezogenic papule.

___ Immunophenotyping - RLE mass: The following tests (antibodies) were performed: ___, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23. Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia/lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ presented to ___ ED on ___ for fecal impaction. In an attempt to disimpact her bowels, she underwent several rounds of enemas, including Golytely and soap suds. She ultimately began to have some fecal output through her ostomy and minimal hard stools via her rectum and was deemed fit for reversal of her ostomy. However, surgery was delayed due to worsening leukocytopenia of unclear etiology; she was administered Neupogen on hospital day 8 with subsequent improvement of her white count. Furthermore, on hospital day 2, she was noted to have urinary retention, with bladder scan revealing >1L fluid. Urology was consulted and believed her urinary symptoms to be due to increased pressure from fecal impaction; they would like her to follow up with the urology clinica as an outpatient to review this further. On hospital day 3, she was noted to have a enterococcalurinary tract infection, likely secondary to the previously described retention and catheterization. She was treated with Macrobid, with resolution of her symptoms. Urinary output remained normal throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.

On hospital day 10 (___), Mrs. ___ was determined to be stable for surgery, with no evidence of colonic obstruction or of impaction, with an improved white count and with resolution of her urinary symptoms. She underwent successful reversal of her ostomy. Prior to the operation, some leg lesions had also been noted and were worrisome for a malignant process. On recommendation from the patient's oncologist, these were also biopsied without complication at the time of her ileostomy.  Immunophenotyping was negative for lymphoma or leukemia and the lesions were thought to be likely piezogenic papules. 

Ms. ___ tolerated the procedure without complications and recovered uneventfully in the PACU before being transferred to the floor in stable condition. (Please see the associated operative report for specific procedural details.)  Post-operatively her pain was controlled with a PCA/IV pain medication with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs. Her diet was advanced slowly and without difficulty. She regained normal bowel function and continued to have good urine output. Her white blood count again began to decrease, but this was expected after Neupogen treatment. She remained hemodynamically stable for her entire hospital course.

She received ___ antibiotics as well as coumadin and lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. Her incision was clean, dry, and intact without evidence of erythema or drainage. She was discharged in stable condition with written instructions concerning precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care, including prescriptions for lovenox and coumadin and instructions to have her INR checked on ___ by the person (Dr. ___ who normally manages her coumadin. All questions were answered prior to discharge, and she expressed readiness for discharge.
