Urine Culture: ___: Final: No growth.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis: OSH: Bilateral partially exophytic renal lesions noted. The largest and most irregular in appearance projects from the R kidney and measures up to approximately 5.4cm. This mass is heterogeneous and is generally of increased density, likely corresponding to the patient's known renal neoplasm. Bladder partially distended and contains dependent clotted blood products. Diverticulosis.  Incidental 18 mm hypodense lesions related to the proximal pancreas, incompletely characterized.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old male with ESRD on HD (___), diastolic heart failure, HTN, known history of bilateral renal masses, BPH who presents with three days of gross hematuria.

# Hematuria: Patient has known history of renal masses since ___ and reports being followed by nephrologist and urologist at ___. He has declined any invasive procedures to determine the identity of these masses in the past. Initially presented to OSH, where CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated known masses with unclear interval change. Patient aware of the possibility of malignancy (renal, bladder, prostate) as the etiology for his hematuria but declined invasive testing during this hospitalization. OSH CT also demonstrated distended bladder with clots and urology was consulted, who placed three way foley for continuous bladder irrigation. Urine analysis equivocal but culture without growth. Patient's hematocrit remained stable and patient was hemodynamically stable as well. Aspirin was held during episode of hematuria, but restarted after improvement of hematuria. Per urology recommendation patient was discharged with a foley in place, which he should keep in for 5 days until he sees his urologist. There was no gross hematuria on CBI clamping trial.

#Anemia: Hematocrit stable after review of outpatient ___ records from ___.

# Pancreatic lesion: The CT scan from ___ also reported presence of incidental pancreatic lesion. Patient will see PCP for further evaluation and management.

# Lower extremity swelling: Continued home Lasix 

# Gout: Stable. Alluporinol renally dosed to 150mg every other day down from 100mg everyday.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. Continued simvastatin.

# BPH: Stable, but prostate may be contributing to hematuria. Continued Terazosin.
