CXR: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Single-lead left-sided AICD is seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right ventricle, unchanged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ with CAD s/p multiple PCIs, ischemic CM (EF 25%), DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia who presents with chest pain that has lasted longer than his typical chest pain.

1. Stable Angina: Patient has a considerable CAD history and is s/p multiple PCI and stent placement including full metal jacket to RCA. The patient presented to the ED because he had his typical cardiac chest pain (left sided, substernal) that lasted longer than his usual chest pain. The patient took 2 nitroglycerin at home with some relief of his chest pain. The pain was associated with slight shortness of breath, but no other symptoms. Of note, the patient gets chest pain a few times per month, which interestingly occurs at rest, but not with exertion. The patient only takes a few SL nitro per month and he says that his angina does not greatly effect his quality of life. In the ED, the patient was chest pain free. He had negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and a normal EKG. The patient was admitted for observation, and he remained chest pain free. On talking with the patient, he has not been compliant with appropriate medications for both his CAD and heart failure. We decided to try to optimize his anti-anginals including putting him on Isosorbide ER 60mg Qday (he had been taking 20mg ?dinitrate? BID). He also was placed back on metoprolol XL 25mg Qday, which he had not been taking at home. The patient will continue aspirin and ticlopidine. He will restart Crestor at 20mg Qday. The patient will follow up with his cardiologist at which time his nitrate can be uptitrated (We did not want to drop his BP too much here).  2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: No TTE done on this admission. The patient was euvolemic. He is not on a home diuretic. He has not been taking his home lisinopril or metoprolol. The patient will restart metorpolol 25mg Qday. He will need an ACEI added as an outpatient and a diuretic as needed for volume. 

3. Hyperlipidemia: Restart Crestor 20mg Qday. The patient has not been taking his Fenofibrate.   4. DM2: Continue metformin and glyburide.   5. HTN: Patient was normotensive here. He has not been taking his amlodipine. He is on isosorbide 60mg Qday and metoprolol 25mg Qday.   6. S/p CVA: ticlid ___ BID, aspirin  7. GERD: Omeprazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: The patient has significant medication complaince issues. Most of his chest pain is likely due to non-adherence with his anti-anginals. We went over the patient's meds on discharge with him two times. The patient was only kept on his most essential meds with changes to be made by his cardiologist PRN.
