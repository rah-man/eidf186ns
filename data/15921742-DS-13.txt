  URINE CULTURE (Final ___:  NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING/STUDIES ___ Transthoracic Echo Report CONCLUSION: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed secondary to pacinginduced dyssynchrony. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 45%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade III diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Normal right ventricular cavity size with depressed free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area less than 1.0 cm2). There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. There is no mitral valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. A left pleural effusion is present. Compared with the prior TTE ___, severe aortic stenosis is now present.

___ CHEST (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema. Persistent bibasilar opacities likely components of pleural effusions and atelectasis noting that infection cannot be entirely excluded. 

___ Renal US  1. 2 new left renal calculi associated with moderate to severe hydroureteronephrosis. However, no definite short-term change since the recent prior CT. 2. Left nephroureteral stent is seen within a dilated left renal pelvis. 3. The right kidney is within normal limits. 

___ Percutaneous nephrostogram 1. Mildly dilated left renal calices with a dilated extrarenal pelvis containing a double-J stent. 2. Nephrostomy tube curled in the renal pelvis. Final image demonstrates aspiration of the contrast and contents of the renal pelvis. 3. Limited contrast nephrostogram indicates that the ureter is likely patient. There is drainage of the contrast from the ureter over time. 

___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study Penetration and aspiration with both liquids and solids, likely secondary to delayed swallow reduced laryngeal vestibule closure.   Please note that a detailed description of dynamic swallowing as well as a summative assessment and recommendations are reported separately in a standalone note by the Speech-Language Pathologist (OMR, Notes, Rehabilitation Services). 

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ with a history of HFpEF, Afib on warfarin, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker placement, and CKD5 (not previously on dialysis), who initially presented as a transfer from ___ with acute on chronic HFpEF exacerbation, found to have new severe AS, course c/b ___ on CKD secondary to cardiorenal syndrome.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # ESRD s/p HD initiation on ___ # L hydronephrosis/hydroureter Patient presented with ___ on CKD, which was initially thought to be secondary to cardiorenal syndrome given aortic stenosis with volume overload, vs possible over-diuresis. Incidentally noticed left-sided hydronephrosis on a CT scan of the chest, so urology was consulted and felt that ureteral tube was likely functioning well and did not need replacement. Renal function continued to decline and patient became encephalopathic requiring urgent HD initiation with improvement in mental status. PCN tube placement was initially deferred due to concern that renal dysfunction was irreversible; however, underwent L PCN with ___ on ___. Despite decompression with PCN, patient was still anuric and PCN with minimal output, therefore it was capped. Monitored for fever, flank pain, and leakage around the tube. Continued sevelamer 800mg TID with meals. Bicarb was discontinued after starting HD. 

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation # Aortic Stenosis Initially presented with hypoxemia and volume overload consistent with acute HFpEF exacerbation. Received IV diuresis with some resolution of hypoxemia and improvement in volume status; however, patient had progressively declining renal function concerning for overdiuresis. TTE on ___ showed progression of aortic stenosis to severe from moderate on prior. Rapid progression of aortic stenosis likely due to calcification iso renal failure. Continued metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO Q6H. Home hydralazine PO increased from 50 to 75 mg TID for greater afterload reduction. Cardiology was consulted given need for HD with likely preload-dependent AS. They felt that risks of TAVR or balloon angioplasty outweighed any possible benefit. She was able to tolerate HD without hypotension. BPs stable in 150s-160s/60s (allowing some permissive hypertension to avoid dropping diastolic blood pressure and to maintain preload). Tentative plan to pursue further evaluation by TAVR team as outpatient, although unlikely that she would be a candidate for this procedure given comorbidities.

#CAUTI - resolved New leukocytosis 16.8 on ___. Patient lethargic but arousable and hemodynamically stable. UCx from ___ grew E coli sensitive to CTX. Foley was removed and patient was given ceftriaxone (___ with improvement in mental status. 

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy # Delirium Intermittent episodes of altered mental status that resolved after initiation of HD and treatment of UTI. Initially felt ___ uremia and hypernatremia, but fluctuating mental status continued despite initiation of HD and normalization of sodium. S/p CT head ___ that was negative for ICH, edema, and mass lesion. Mental status stabilized prior to discharge.

# Malnutrition # Dysphagia # Hypernatremia Poor PO intake and hypoalbuminemia suggesting malnutrition. Evaluated by S&S who noted some difficulty with thin liquids and solids. Nutrition and speech/swallow were consulted. Video swallow evaluation showed silent aspiration; however, after discussion with son/HCP, it was deemed more within ___ to allow patient to continue to eat for comfort. Encouraged PO free-water intake for hypernatremia. 

# ___ Patient has been persistently/intermittently encephalopathic throughout her prolonged hospital course. She will be discharged to a facility with lifelong dependence on hemodialysis. She is also having some dysphagia requiring diet modification. However, her mental status has shown considerable improvement with initiation of hemodialysis and treatment of UTI. Patient silently aspirating by video-swallow eval, but allowed to eat for comfort despite aspiration risk after discussion with HCP. 

# Atrial fibrillation CHADS2-VASc 6. Warfarin intermittently held for procedures (tunneled HD catheter, PCN tube). INR was highly variable, likely iso poor nutrition and dose of levofloxacin earlier in course. Restarted prior to discharge. Continued metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6hrs, consolidated to metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily for home dosing. 

CHRONIC ISSUES ================ # Hypertension Continued home amlodipine 10mg daily and increased hydralazine to 75mg TID # Type 2 diabetes Stopped glipizide permanently given ESRD. Insulin sliding scale initially while inpatient, but later stopped with BGs in 100s-200s, therefore not discharge insulin not continued. # Gout Continued home allopurinol ___ every other day, dosed renally. # Hyperlipidemia Continued home atorvastatin 10mg qpm. # GERD Continued home Zantac 150mg daily

___ issues ============= Discharge creatinine 3.4 Discharge weight 58.2 Kg Discharge hemoglobin 8.1 Discharge INR 2.5 Discharge WBC: 10.4 

[ ] Please recheck CBC on ___ to make sure WBC is not worsening. It was 10.4 on discharge. [ ] Please continue to check HD line site as it has looked red, but has been improving. (Outlined with marker.) [ ] If patient unable to tolerate HD, may be in the setting of severe aortic stenosis -- could consider discussing balloon valvuloplasty vs. TAVR, if within goals of care. Deferred during this hospitalization because patient was hemodynamically stable with hemodialysis and the risks of the procedure were felt to outweigh any possible benefit. [ ] Given macrocytic anemia and high ferritin, patient was started on B12 supplementation and taken off iron supplementation. Iron studies and B12 level should be followed up as outpatient. [ ] Found to have incidental 19 x 16 mm cyst pancreatic cysts on CT abdomen and pelvis. For pancreatic cysts measuring more than 1.5cm, patients should be referred to the pancreas cyst clinic for consultation. These referrals can be made by emailing ___ or by calling ___. [ ] Please ensure follow up with interventional radiology for removal of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes ___ weeks post-discharge and with urology for left ureteral stent removal. She needs follow-up with Dr. ___ in ___ for management of left ureteral stent. [ ] Please monitor output from PCN q6hrs and monitor PCN for signs of leakage or flank pain. [ ] Has known moderate-sized, bilateral pleural effusions. If imaging is obtained, be aware that these effusions are chronic in nature, and that volume status is now being managed through hemodialysis sessions as patient is oliguric.
