Noted that he never had such symptoms before. Noted that he only had intermittent abdominal discomfort for which he took MS contin intermittently, and rarely oxycodone (as he fears he will be addicted).

CARDIAC CATH ___: FINDINGS: Normal left and right heart filling pressures. RECOMMENDATIONS: Maximize medical therapy.  Brief Hospital Course: PATIENT SUMMARY ================ ___ PMH prostate cancer (s/p brachytherapy ___, metastatic HER-2 positive esophageal adenocarcinoma (progressed on multiple regimens, s/p cycle 2 pembrolizumab), HLD, T2DM, who presented to ED with sharp RUQ pain, right shoulder pain, and pain with deep inspiration x 1 day on ___. Work up for infection was negative and pain deemed to be pain from capsular distension from his growing liver metastasis shown on CT done ___. Due to limited options and with input of cardio-oncology consultation, decision was made to retry FOLFOX regimen despite prior episodes of documented coronary vasospasm. Calcium channel blocker and long acting nitrate was initiated prior to treating with FOLFOX in order to attempt to prevent recurrent vasospasm. FOLFOX initiated ___, however, again complicated by chest pain with ST elevations with quick resolution with SL NTG c/w coronary vasospasm. Episode of recurrent CP that night despite stopping ___ infusion prompting FICU transfer for possible nitro gtt. TTE done in FICU remarkable for new decreased EF of 30% with global hypokinesis. No troponin or CKmb elevation was noted, which supported direct cardiotoxicity of ___ rather than an ischemic event related to coronary vasospasm. Due to the new cardiomyopathy, cardiology recommended a cardiac catheterization to rule out ischemic cardiomyopathy and significant atherosclerotic lesion precipitating vasospasm. Cath done on ___ was notable for absence of obstructive CAD. Based on direct cardiac toxicity, patient will not be trialed on ___ again. His primary oncologist, Dr. ___ met with the patient and discussed the likely limited utility of further aggressive chemotherapy, but left the options open for trying alternative regimens going forward. He was discharged with oncology follow up ___.

ACUTE ISSUES ============ # RUQ abdominal Pain, Indigestion: # ___ induced coronary vasospasm and cardiotoxicity #Metastatic Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: See extensive oncologic history in admission H&P. Overall, patient has progressed through multiple treatment regimens. CEA did have some downtrend in limited exposure to FOLFOX, but had two incomplete cycles ___ documented coronary vasospasm from ___. CT scan ___ showed continued progression of disease despite pembro treatment. Decision was made to again try FOLFOX with medical therapy designed to prevent vasospasm (CCB and nitrates). This unfortunately failed as patient had diffuse (primarily anterior) ST elevations and chest pain 26 hr's after initiation of ___ infusion. Required ICU transfer for monitoring. No troponin or CKmb, but TTE with new decrease in EF to 30% best explained by direct cardiotoxic effect of ___ vs Stunning from ___ and/or large CCB dose. Symptomatic improvement was achieved with new medications outlined below in the transitional issues. Chemotherapy options going forward are quite limited and this was discussed with the patient in detail, both from the OMED team and from his primary oncologist ML ___.

# New HFrEF (EF 30%): New ___ TTE with EF of 30% and global hypokinesis (had normal EF on ___ TTE). Had event of coronary vasospasm and ___ infusion in the interval between those TTE's, but no troponin or CKmb elevation to suggest infarction. Thought to be from stunning from ___ vs. direct cardiotoxic effect of ___. Patient asymptomatic and euvolemic. Cardiac cath ___ without obstructive CAD. Initiated on goal directed therapy, discharged on home losartan 25 and new metoprolol XL 50 mg daily. Aspirin and atorvastatin were continued but their utility should be evaluated going forward given poor prognosis from cancer and absence of obstructing CAD.

#Fever #Leukocytosis The patient was found to be febrile on presentation to ED and received 1 dose vanc/zosyn. Has been intermittently febrile overnight but no further antibiotics given as thought to be malignancy driven. Infectious workup was negative. Patient also with mild leukocytosis but appears to be stable. No focal symptoms to suggest infection. VQ scan and duplex negative making DVT or PE less likely as a cause of fever.

#Anemia Patient with chronic anemia with a hemoglobin around 10 in the setting of active malignancy. Patient also has a history of hemorrhoids and had an episode of bright red blood per rectum. On admission the patient's hemoglobin was around 8 and has been there since about ___. Iron studies showed a low iron low ferritin and elevated TIBC. Given his low iron the patient was not immediately transfused given active chemotherapy infusion.

#Mild Hypercalcemia/Hyperparathyroidism Patient with corrected calcium of 11 on admission. This was thought to be due to primary hyperparathyroidism and PTH level was elevated which is consistent with that diagnosis. The patient's calcium was monitored daily during his admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES ============== #Constipation Thought to be opioid induced constipation that was treated with MiraLAX and senna and lactulose.

#Hypertension - Home losartan 25mg

#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Appears to be well controlled with most readings < 200. restarted home metformin on discharge

Transitional Issues ==================== NEW MEDICATIONS - Cardiac Meds: Metoprolol XL 50 mg daily, aspirin, atorvastatin. - GI Meds: Omeprazole 20 mg BID, Sucralfate QID, Polyethylene glycol BID:PRN, Senna BID, Simethacone BID

[ ] Increase metoprolol and losartan doses as tolerated to encourage cardiac recovery. [ ] Patient has direct cardiotoxicity and coronary vasospasm from ___, do not give this medication. [ ] Patient has limited chemotherapy options going forward and has relatively poor prognosis despite good functional status. [ ] Patient had significant symptomatic improvement with the addition of the GI medications above [ ] Patient has had intermittent fevers without infectious source, suspect tumor fevers. [ ] Patient has remained full code despite likely limited life span going forward, please address in the outpatient setting. [ ] If limited by decreased EF in terms of chemo regimen, recommend repeating TTE in ___ weeks as suspect likely to have recovery of EF.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It has been a privilege to assist in your care.

You were admitted with right upper abdominal pain. We did very extensive imaging and other testing. The pain is likely from stretching of the liver capsule due to cancer.

We adjusted your medications for pain and for preventing constipation. We talked to specialty teams including heart doctors and your ___ doctor. You were started on chemotherapy and monitored closely for any reactions. Unfortunately you suffered a cardiac event likely related to the FOLFOX chemotherapy. The chemotherapy was stopped and cardiology saw you. Cardiology performed a coronary angiography which showed that you did not have any blockages in the arteries of your heart. 

Dr. ___ that, unfortunately, your cancer has not been particularly sensitive. For that reason, she is not planning on giving you further chemo at this time. Instead, we intent to focus on maximizing your quality of life and decreasing your symptoms. 

You will meet with your cancer doctor, ___, in clinic to discuss your next options for chemotherapy.

Sincerely, Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
