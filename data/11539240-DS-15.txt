IMAGING CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly with interval development of mild interstitial edema. Unchanged consolidation in the right lung base which remains concerning for pneumonia.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ w/ extensive PMHx including dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 15%), mitral stenosis s/p MVR x2 w/mechanical valve ___, BiV pacer, afib, breast cancer, with recently diagnosed pneumonia, presenting with hypoxia.

ACTIVE ISSUES

# Hypoxia: Differential included underlying pneumonia with possible mucus plugging leading to hypoxia vs. fluid overload from heart failure. Clinical picture was mixed given her ___ with elev BUN/Cr, lack of b/l crackles, in setting of also peripheral edema and elevated BNP. She was initially started on HCAP coverage with cefepime and vancomycin. CXR showed no difference in pneumonia from previously and exam was not significantly changed, so IV antibiotics were stopped and she was switched back to levofloxacin. CXR did show mild increase in pulmonary edema. She was minimally diuresed with 20mg IV Lasix x1. Diuresis was then held given concern for her ___.  Half of home dose of 10mg furosemide was started on discharge.

# Pneumonia: CXR did not reveal significant difference from outpatient CXR. She was initially started on vanc/cefepime and this was subsequently scaled back to levofloxacin which she had previously been covered with as an outpatient. She remained with 2L O2 requirement, desatting to high ___ with activity on RA. She will require 1 more dose of levofloxacin on ___, then this should be stopped and will have completed the ___: Thought consistent with pre-renal etiology given her dry MM and having been ill over last few days with lower PO intake, as well as not being able to take as much PO in setting of her neck brace. However, cardio-renal syndrome is also on differential given her high BNP and slightly increased pulm edema. ___ have decreased intravascular volume but overall volume up. Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology with Fe Urea 30%, and high urine osms. Had improved to 1.4 and back up slightly to 1.5 on discharge.

# Troponin leak: Possibly ___ some element of HF in setting of her decreased renal function. EKG difficult to interpret ___ BiV pacing. Monitored on telemetry. Troponin and CK-MB unchanged after cycling x2. 

# Systolic chronic CHF: Mixed clinical picture, as above, whether she was overloaded given weight was down and had likely pre-renal ___ but BNP elevated and significant peripheral edema.  Minimal diuresis attempted with 20mg IV Lasix. This was then discontinued as was her home furosemide. Digoxin and enalapril held in setting ___ initially. Half of home dose digoxin restarted on discharge. Enalapril held on discharge and should be held until Cr 1.2 or less. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 

# Mechanical valve: INR elevated at 4.2 on admission; goal is 2.5-3.5 so held warfarin initially. Once INR within range, restarted warfarin at lower dose given fluoroquinolone would increase efficacy of warfarin. 

# Hypertension: pt currently normotensive with SBPs in low 100s, seems to be at her outpatient baseline. Carvedilol continued.  Enalapril held as above; should restart when Cr 1.2 or less.

 Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted at ___. You were admitted due to hypoxia, or low oxygen saturation. You were found to have pneumonia consistent with what you had been diagnosed with as an outpatient. You were briefly started on IV antibiotics but these were stopped and you were switched back to the same antibiotic you were previously taking, levofloxacin. You were started on supplemental oxygen.

Your furosemide was CHANGED to a lower dose of 10mg daily. Your digoxin was CHANGED to a lower dose due to your acute kidney injury. Your warfarin was CHANGED to different dosing schedule for better adjustment of your INR. Your enalapril was STOPPED for now given your acute kidney injury.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.  Followup Instructions: ___
