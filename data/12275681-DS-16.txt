Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: ___ year-old with sudden onset SS chest pain radiating to both arms and jaw. The pain began ___ at 6PM, after a long and anxiety provoking telephone conversation with her daughter.  There was no associated nausea or abdominal pain. There was fear and SOB. She took NTG x 2 w/ minimal relief and called 911. There was no antecedent illness. She's had similar pain increasing in frequency, has been taking increasing amounts of SL NTG with varying effectiveness. Exertion (walking across the room) and anxiety are the most consistent provocations, though the pain has occured at rest. She does have SOB with exertion at baseline.

Of note, she had a recent admission in ___ with similar presentation and was ruled out and discharged. She has been taking the NTG since that time.

In the ED, the pain resolved with morphine 2mg IV. Got ASA 325.  No changes on EKG (paced rhythm). Tn negative x 2. BP stable between 130 and 140. No changes on CXR. She was admitted for ___ as deemed too medically complex to be in observation.

___ EKG: No ST changes. Paced rhythm.

___ CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable prominent cardiomegaly and hyperinflation.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old woman with remarkably little PMH and no documented cardiac disease who presents with substernal chest pain brought on by anxiety, radiation to arms and jaw, with SOB, only slightly relieved by NTG. There was a similar presentation in ___ and a number of episodes since, less severe but similar in quality, provoked by exertion and or anxiety, and decreasingly improved by increasing NTG use. Her pain was controlled with morphine in the ED. There were no changes on EKG. Troponins were negative x 2. She stayed overnight for monitoring and was discharged without incident on hospital day 2.

# Chest pain. This is typical chest pain probably representing stable angina. She takes sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.  Her blood remained somewhat high throughout the presentation.  We began a trial of 30mg isosorbide and recommended discontinuing or at least cutting back on her SL NTG. We also felt that anxiety was a significant contributor to her chest pain (as an exertional equivalent), and we discussed increasing her sertraline. She will see Dr. ___ on ___.

# Anxiety. She readily acknowledges getting quite upset when anxious, and that her relationship with her daughter has been a frequent source of anxiety. Per per request, we arranged a social work consult. It may be considered to increase her sertraline dose.

# HTN. Stable initially in 160s - 170s; after initiation of isosorbide mononitrate and perhaps some reassurance, BP trended down into 130s - 140s. Maintained home meds and as above.

# Hypothyroidism, SVT, psoriasis, GERD. These issues were stable. Home meds continued.
