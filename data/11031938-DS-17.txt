ECG - Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Intraventricular conduction delay. Possible left ventricular hypertrophy. No previous tracing available for comparison.

RUQ U/S - Distended gallbladder associated with diffuse wall thickening and sludge, in the presence of right upper quadrant pain are concerning for acute cholecystitis.

MRCP - Mild gallbladder wall thickening, enhancement and small volume pericholecystic fluid, suggest cholecystitis in the appropriate clinical setting, similar compared with recent ultrasound. Few small gallstones. There is ___ile duct stones. Common bile duct measures 0.7 cm in diameter.  ERCP -   Limited exam of the esophagus was normal   Limited exam of the stomach was normal   Limited exam of the duodenum was normal   The scout film was normal.   The major papilla appeared normal.   The CBD was successfully cannulated with the Hydratome sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035in guidewire.   The guidewire was advanced into the intrahepatic biliary tree.   Contrast injection revealed a CBD of approximately 8mm in diameter and a 7mm filling defect consitent with a stone in the distal CBD.   The intrahepatic biliary tree appeared normal.   A sphincterotomy was successfully performed at the 12 o'clock position.   No post sphincterotomy bleeding was noted.   The CBD was swept several times with successfu8l removal of a small stone.   Occlusion cholangiogram showed no further filling defects.   There was excellent spontaneous drainage of bile and contrast at the end of the procedure.   The PD was not injected or cannulated.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o F with PMHx of hypothyroidism, HLD, GERD, HTN, who presented with 1 days of epigastric/RUQ pain with associated N/V. OSH imaging showed concerns for cholecystitis, for which she was transferred to ___ for ERCP evaluation. Surgery also involved. Imaging here confirmed cholecystitis. S/p ERCP with sphx and stone extraction, planning for interval CCY.

# Cholecystitis / CBD stones: Seen on imaging. ERCP and surgery services following. Underwent ERCP with sphx and stone extraction. LFT's downtrended. Given mild ongoing pain on exam, surgery service planning for interval CCY in several weeks. Pt remained afebrile in house. She was initially treated with Unasyn, which was transitioned to Augment at discharge. She will continue this until her surgery.

# Hyponatremia: Mild. Likely hypovolemic in the setting of poor PO intake. 

# HTN: Antihypertensive agents were initially held ___ concern for infection. However, Bp remained elevated during admission. Her regimen was gradually restarted. She remained hypertensive at discharge. BP should be monitored in the outpatient setting and BP regimen adjusted accordingly.

You had a procedure called an ERCP, during which you had a small cut made to open up your bile ducts as well as removal of a gallstone. You will follow up with the surgeons to arrange for removal of your gallbladder. You should continue antibiotics until you have your gallbladder removed.

Of note, your blood pressures were elevated while you were in the hospital, likely from your blood pressure medications initially being held because of your infection.
