 History of Present Illness: ___ w/ PMH significant for COPD not on home O2, HTN, CAD, and diverticulitis, sent to ED from PCP's office at ___ for 20lb weight gain since ___, increasing abdominal girth, and pain in her left flank.

Pt states that since she was hospitalized for colitis in ___ at ___, her legs have been puffy, and she has had reduced urine output. It has been worsening acutely over the last few weeks. She normally weighs 123 lbs, but weighted 136 in ___. Yesterday, she weighed 148 lbs. Pt also feels that her abdominal girth has been increasing, which she feels has exacerbated her back pain.

Pt experiences intermittent "attacks" of back pain/spasm, which last days to weeks. Pt ususally takes old pills which she has saved of ibuprofen, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, and tizanidine when this occurs. Her current back pain spell has lasted for ___ weeks. She also sometimes experiences "weakness" of her legs, but states that she walks normally. Pain prevents her from lifting her legs. Denies any numbness or stool/urine incontinence.

Regarding her abdominal pain, Pt was admitted in ___ for bloody diarrhea and was found on CT to have colitis involving the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. Extensive stool studies for infectious cause were all negative.

Biopsy was normal.

Per Pt's PCP, ___ was complaining about abdominal bloating and L sided flank pain. Pt also had bilateral pedal edema up to abdomen. Pt also had a chest CT to work up a known stable chest nodule, with incidentally found L sided renal stone of 4mm. Pt has a history of kidney stones. Pt states that her current back pain feels different from her kidney stone.

Regarding her weight gain, Pt was recently seen in cardiology clinic on ___ by Dr. ___ felt that Pt's peripheral edema may be due to increased pulmonary pressures given her underlying COPD.

No acute intracranial abnormality, with chronic findings, as above. 2. Possible acute inflammatory findings involving the dominant sphenoid air cell; correlate clinically.   CT C-Spine ___ IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.    CXR PA/LAT ___ Examination is somewhat limited by positioning and AP technique.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis, elsewhere there is no focal opacity. No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is seen. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. Deviation of the trachea to the right is unchanged. There is tortuosity and calcification of the aorta. A calcified granuloma at the right base appears unchanged. Degenerateive changes and multiple levels of retrolisthesis seen in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions noted.   L Knee X-Ray ___ - No acute fracture or dislocation is seen. No joint effusion at the knee is detected. There are dense vascular calcifications. Incidental note is made of likely enchondroma in the distal femur. The bones are diffusely demineralized.   HIP ___ - No acute fracture or dislocation. Stable appearance of total hip arthroplasties.  Hand/Wrist ___ There is a transverse, impacted fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment (Colles' type fracture) without definite intraarticular extension. The bones are diffusely demineralized. There is also a minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture. There are degenerative changes notable at the first carpometacarpal and triscaphe joints. Well corticated osseous fragment seen just proximal to the trapezium on the oblique view which was present on prior exam. Degenerative changes are also noted along the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints   Wrist ___: Status post two reductions, after impacted fracture of the distal radius. Expected alignment of fractured bony elements. Expected alignment of fractures.   Right Knee ___: There is no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. The minimal joint effusion might be present. Dense vascular soft tissue calcifications, as an incidental finding, an enchondroma might be present in the distal right femur. No periarticular soft tissue swelling  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a ___ yo female with PMHx CKD (cr 1.6-2.1), Chronic sCHF with LVEF35%, CAD, HTN, HLD, and hypothyroidism sent in s/p fall found to have a R distal radius fracture, delirious in ED after reduction of fracture and Morphine 5mg IV.    # Distal R Radius Fracture: Seen by orthopedics in ED who successfully reduced fracture and splinted with overlying stitches due to skin tear. Films showed successful reduction. While in acute delirium patient self-removed splint in ED which was replaced by ortho and follow up films showed successful reduction. Pain was controlled with standing tylenol and prn tramadol (though she did not require prn doses). Discharged with gram positive coverage for prophylactic cellulitis to continue total 5 day course.    # UTI: Dirty urinalysis in the ED. UTI ___ grew resistant E. Coli (S only to Meropenem and Cefepime). Patient did not complain of dysuria though baseline dementia confounding clinical picture. Delirium likely exacerbated by UTI which may also have precipitated unwitnessed fall. Ceftriaxone 1gram IV was started for UTI since bactrim avoided for CKD and avoided Cipro given Delirium risk in elderly dementia patients. She was broadened to Cefepime given prior resistant organisms, and she received 2 doses total (Q24hours). Additionally, Cefepime gives GPC coverage for coverage of skin tear. After urine culture came back with pan-sensitive Citrobacter she was switched to Levofloxacin 250mg PO Q48hours in order to complete 7 day course for complicated cystitis. Levofloxacin will cover citrobacter and also confer GPC coverage for skin tear. Bactrim was not chosen because eGFR of 13. Cephalosporin not chosen because Citrobacter can become resistant within ___ days of treatment.      # Delirium: Acute delirium on chronic baseline dementia. AOx1 at baseline, delirious in ED and removed splinting. She was given 5mg IV morphine in the ED and patient became somnolent and slept all night and the following day. Acute exacerbation of mental status likely multifactorial from pain, trauma, opiate administration in ED and UTI. Continued home meds Aripiprazole 5mg at 2pm and 2.5mg Qhs. Patient did not require Haldol during admission. Treated UTI as above, avoided Opiates and treated pain with standing Tylenol and tramadol prn.   # CHF: Chronic, systolic CHF with LVEF of 35%, ischemic in origin and s/p stenting. No evidence of acute exacerbation on admission. Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID, Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY, Clopidogrel 75 mg PO/NG DAILY, Lisinopril 10 mg PO/NG DAILY and Furosemide 20 mg PO/NG DAILY per home regimen. Per discussion with daughter her nurse practitioner had discontinued aspirin to limit PO medications. Aspirin was restarted on admission. If she requires medication limitations then would discontinue Plavix but continue Aspirin given history of stenting.   # HTN: Chronic, stable with good control. CKD may be complication. Continued lisinopril and metoprolol as above   # Hypothyroidism: Chronic, stable. Continued Levothyroxine 75 mcg PO DAILY    # Social issues: Patient lives in assisted living facility but as of right now does not appear she can care for herself. She was evaluated by physical therapy who thought she would benefit from inpatient physical rehabilitation. She was discharged to ___ rehab. She may require more aggressive 24 hour home monitoring. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # CODE: DNR per sheet from ___  # CONTACT: ___ (___)  # HCP is ___ ___ or ___ # Being treated with Levofloxacin, if delirium worsens this may by quinolone related and consider changing medications to Bactrim to complete 7 day course ___ Day 1) # Delirium management is important: Reorientation, sleep wake cycle and avoid narcotics # If considering limiting medications then would discontinue Plavix but continue Aspirin. Would not discontinue calcium or vitamin D given recent admission for wrist fracture and she continues to be high fall/fracture risk. # She will require 24 hour care at home unless mental and physical status improve at Rehab.
