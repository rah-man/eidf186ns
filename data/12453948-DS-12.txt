 Name: ___         Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Percocet  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: Left lower-extremity weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None

 History of Present Illness: Mrs. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic colorectal cancer s/p LAR (___) c/b lung mets s/p resection with recurrence and sacral mets who presents with LLE weakness x 2 weeks. The weakness began subtly, but has steadily progressed to the point where she required a cane to walk a few days prior to admission. Also with increasing L back pain x 3 weeks. No trauma. No incontinence. Has baseline neuropathy in feet, but no worsening numbness. No difficulty with speech. No fevers/chills/night sweats. Denies cough, shortness of breath, chest pain. No N/V/D. Chronic constipation. 

She is actively undergoing treatment for her sacral mets.  Current treatment includes: ___ C1W2 of erbitux, XRT to sacrum (total 30Gy completed ___

While in the ED, she was seen by Neurology, who felt her exam was " notable for UMN pattern weakness in all extremities, with the greatest weakness in her ___ - still in an UMN pattern, but with some radicular component as well. Bilateral extensor plantar responses also support UMN lesion. Therefore, she has evidence of a cervical myelopathy by exam; a concomitant thoracic myelopathy can't be ruled out. She does also have evidence of a left L5 radiculopathy. Etiology of concern is of course spinal mets; in the absence of these, spondylosis may cause a cervical myelopathy, but she already has known mets to the sacrum....The mild abnormalities on mental status testing can be seen after chemotherapy, although she should have brain imaging at some point, as well." An emergent Spine MRI with and without contrast was recommended. 

Several hours passed before MRI was available. The patient was then premedicated for pain and anxiety and taken down for MRI; however, soon after getting on the table she refused to complete the exam. The study was aborted and she was brought back to the ED. The resident caring for her in the ED was unable to persuade her to go back down to complete the study. The Heme Onc fellow and neurology consult resident were made aware. The neurology team felt there was no indication for urgent steroids and recommended repeat attempt at MRI in AM.

Also while in the ED she was noted to have a 6 point Hct drop over 5 hours (from 34.6 to 28.7). he was guiac positive on exam. A stat CT abd was done to rule out RP bleed, this was negative. Hct was repeated and returned at 30.3.

She is admitted to ___ for further workup and management.  Past Medical History: Oncologic history: The patient was initially diagnosed with colon cancer in ___ after presenting with abdominal pain and cramping. She underwent low anterior resection on ___ with removal of a 2 x 4.3 x 0.7 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that extended to the serosal surface. ___ lymph nodes were involved and there was perineural invasion. On ___, an area in segment 4 of the liver suspicious for metastasis was resected and her gallbladder was removed. Pathology showed the lesion was benign. She had stage III, T4, N1, M0 disease. She received ___ and leucovorin chemotherapy from ___ to ___. In ___, she developed pulmonary nodules. On ___, she underwent wedge resection of the right lower lobe, right upper lobe, and right middle lobe lesions. The right lower lobe lesion was a 1 cm adenocarcinoma, the right upper lesion was a 1.8 cm adenocarcinoma, and the right middle lobe lesion was a pleural scar. She received ___, oxaliplatin, and Avastin from ___ to ___. In ___, she developed recurrent lung lesions and received FOLFOX and Avastin from ___ through ___. Her lung lesions stabilized and CyberKnife radiotherapy was considered. The patient and her physicians instead decided to treat the area surgically. She underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection on ___, with resection of an FDG avid lesion. In ___, she had  progression of bilateral lung and pleural disease. She received FOLFOX and Avastin from ___ to ___. The chemotherapy was stopped to give the patient a break from the side effects of therapy. Most recent surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on ___, showed an increase in bilateral pulmonary nodules compared to scan performed on ___.

IMAGING: ====== CT Abd/Pelvis (___): IMPRESSION: 1. No retroperitoneal bleed. 2. Increased number and size of pulmonary metastases seen at the visualized portion of the lung bases. 

MRI from OSH in ___: FINDINGS: The sagittal images extended only as far caudally as the T11 region. Best seen on the sagittal T1-weighted images are numerous areas of low signal intensity within multiple cervical and thoracic vertebral bodies, consistent with widely disseminated osseous metastatic disease. Within the limitations of this abbreviated study, there is no overt cord compression identified due to metastatic osseous or epidural lesions, although the absence of cross-sectional scans through most of the spine precludes a comprehensive assessment, in this regard. In that light, the available incomplete axial coverage of the cervical spine, as well, is extremely degraded by patient motion. There is demonstration of mild cervical spondylosis at the C4-5 through C6-7 levels, with tiny osteophytes at C5-6 and C6-7 contacting the ventral cord margin. There is no definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The foramen magnum and its contents are normal. 

 MRI L-spine (___): FINDINGS: Since the prior examination there appears to be some progression of the metastatic lesions involving the left sacral ala and body of the sacrum, extending in the latter area just slightly to the right of midline. The coronal oblique images appear to show infiltration of the left S1 through S3 foraminal fat. Metastatic disease involving the right iliac bone appears to have progressed, as well. A lesion in the right sacral ala has nearly doubled in size. Also, multiple lumbar spine vertebral signal abnormalities have developed, consistent with dramatic progression of metastatic disease in that locale. However, the central spinal canal does not appear to have any interval new epidural disease develop, and thus there is no apparent compression of the cauda equina. No overt new paraspinal disease is seen.  The urinary bladder is moderately dilated.  CONCLUSION: Findings appear consistent with dramatic progression of bony metastatic disease, along with infiltration of the left-sided S1-3 sacral foramina, as noted above.

MRI brain (___): CONCLUSION: No sign of brain metastases. Bony metastases involving the upper cervical spine as noted above. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with metastatic colorectal cancer s/p LAR (___) complicated by lung mets s/p resection with recurrence, and sacral mets currently on cetuximab who presented with acute LLE weakness. 

# Acute LLE weakness/back pain: The patient has known spinal metastases seen on MRI ___. Given her increasing back pain and acute onset of focal weakness, this is concerning for cord compression. She was unable to tolerate the MRI of her lumbar spine while in the ED. She was started on 1 gm of solumedrol the morning after admission and continued on 100 mg q6h. This was transitioned to 4 mg decadron q6h and she was discharged on a slow taper. She underwent an MRI of her lumbar spine which showed no evidence of spinal cord compression, but did show left foraminal nerve compression likely causing her weakness.  Radiation oncology was consulted but stated she had already had radiation to that region and could not be given more. The family met with Dr. ___ the patient and decided to transition to hospice. As she wanted to be discharged over the weekend hospice couldn't be fully set up prior to discharge, but will be set up next week as an outpatient. 

# Anemia: The patient's Hct ranged from 26 to 34, and prior to discharge was 30.8. Her baseline is in the mid-30___. CT abd/pelvis in ED showed no evidence of an RP bleed. Guaiac positive on rectal exam and may have slow bleeding from metastatic lesions in the GI tract, however her Hct remained stable.  # Mild altered mental status: Neuro consult in the ED was concerned about mild cognitive impairment. She underwent an MRI of the brain which showed no evidence of cerebral metastases. 

# Hypothroidism: She was continued on levothyroxine. 

# CODE: DNR/DNI. The patient was full code initially, but after discussion by Dr. ___ with the patient and her family, she decided to be made DNR/DNI and go home on hospice.
