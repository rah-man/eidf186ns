 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, diastolic CHF (LVEF > 55%), T2DM, CKD (baseline Cr 1.8), OSA s/p recent stay for HYPOvolemic hyponatremia, readmitted with hyponatremia and volume overload. . # Hyponatremia: Renal was consulted. Patient's presentation of hyponatremia likely a combination of factors. Polydipsia/increased free H2O intake--patient and family report increased intake of free water, particularly because she was drinking in response to increased cough (as well as other ailments). SIADH--contribution of chronic pain in context of recent MVC, rib fx, etc. Minor contributor of hypervolemia with CHF--patient clearly volume overloaded on arrival. Patient's hyponatremia resolved with fluid restriction and aggressive education regarding fluid restriction. Patient was also re-initiated on torsemide at a dose of 60 daily. Patient to follow up with outpatient lab studies and with cardiology. . # Acute on chronic kidney injury: Creatinine ___ at baseline, 3.2 on follow up labs on day before admission. Unclear if she has been taking diuretics since discharge, although appears she has not. Improved with diuresis. . # Atrial fibrillation: Continued metoprolol, coumadin. . # Chronic diastolic CHF: EF >55%. Restarted home torsemide at reduced dose from prior doses. . Transitional Issues: - Patient admitted because of hyponatremia likely due to a combination of increased free water intake (polydipsia) as well as potentially a component of SIADH due to chronic pain, which improved with fluid restriction - Patient being discharged on regimen of PO torsemide 60 daily. Please consider re-initiating patient on spironolactone as an outpatient - Please work with patient to develop regimens to help control her chronic pain, which may be a minor contributor to her hyponatremia - Patient has not been taking her aspirin; we have recommended re-initiating this medication and will discharge her with a prescription - Please note, there was some concern that patients son is discarding her ___ medications indicating she doesnt need to take them.
