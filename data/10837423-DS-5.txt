IMAGING: ================= CTA (___): IMPRESSION: 1. Acute pulmonary embolism involving the right lower lobe branch, extending into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches. There is associated right lower lobe pulmonary wedge-shaped opacity which could reflect involving infarction. 2. No evidence of right heart strain. 3. Small to moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.

Clot was found to involve right lower lobe branch and extend into segmental and subsegmental branches. He also had a wedge shaped opacity suggestive of evolving infarction. He had no evidence of right heart strain. His PE severity index was 113 (high risk) given history of malignancy. 

The patient was admitted to the medical floor for management. He was noted to be hemodynamically stable without dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia, or hypoxia. He had no evidence of right heart strain on EKG, CTA or labs (Trop and BNP). Given his allergy to Lovenox, with unclear cross-reactivity to Unfractionated heparin and no contraindications, Apixaban was started at a dose of 10mg BID for 7 days. He received his first dose on the night of admission on ___. 

He remained stable overnight, slept well without new or recurrent chest pain or hemodynamic instability. He was monitored on telemetry without events. Given hemodynamic stability and Low-Risk PE (as evidence by hemodynamic stability and no evidence of right heart strain), he was discharged on hospital day 2 with a sixty pill supply of apixiban pending follow-up with his primary care physician and selection of long-term DOAC option given dosing, ___ and risks/benefits.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ======================== -will need to reduce apixaban dose to 5mg BID after first seven days of therapy - likely will need hematology evaluation prior to stopping anticoagulation given this is his second unprovoked clot, may need lifelong therapy - will need evaluation to ensure he is up to date on cancer screening (colonoscopy recommended over cologuard) as well as prostate cancer follow up - aspirin was stopped given does not meet criteria for primary prevention of CAD and apixaban initiation   Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. Apixaban 5 mg PO BID RX *apixaban [Eliquis] 5 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Disp #*60 Tablet Refills:*0
