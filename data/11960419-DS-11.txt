Electrophysiology report: Placement of ___ EnRhythm pacemaker  Brief Hospital Course: Summary: This is a ___ yom with history of CAD s/p CABG ___, s/p PCI, dCHF, recurrent GIB, AVR, Recent admission for endocarditis 2 months ago, AAA, Afib, gout prostate ca who presented to OSH with SOB transferred here for further care and management of CHF.  .  Assessment/Plan: . #. Acute on Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient presented with fluid overload with a precipitant being either viral bronchitis, atrial fibrillation and/or ineffective pacing. Cardiac biomarkers x 2 ruled out a myocardial infarction as the precipitant. An echocardiogram showed no valvular abnormalities that could explain his CHF. The patient was aggressively diuresed with BID lasix dropping his weight from 76.6 kg (admission)-->68.2 kg (discharge). The patient was observed on Lasix 40 mg PO BID which seemed to work well for his volume status. The patient was continued on his home statin, ace inhibitor, furosemide, and aspirin. His beta blocker was held due to his rhythm (discussed below). His metoprolol should be started as an outpatient. 

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation, which might have been contributing to his heart failure. The patient had unknown duration of atrial fibrillation and presented with a subtherapeutic INR at 1.8, so he needed a TEE, which showed no clot. Next, the patient underwent DC cardioversion which converted him to sinus rhythm, however, this rhythm quickly reverted back to atrial fibrillation. The electrophysiologists recommended initiating dofetilide. After three days of dofetilide, the patient's rhythm was atrial flutter. He was once again taken for DC cardioversion which proved successful into converting him into sinus rhythm. He will continue dofetilide as an outpatient.

# Complete heart block: After suffering from endocarditis on his previous hospitalization, the patient had an external pacer placed for complete heart block. On admission, the patient was noted to pace on his own and also pace with the device. The device settings were lowered from 75 to 50 and the patient was initiating heartbeats on his own with some use of the pacer. Since the patient was no longer infected from endocarditis, his external pacer was unscrewed and an internal pacer was implanted on the right side. The left side was attempted, however, he had clot in his vein. The patient received ___ antibiotics and did not have any complications of infection or hematoma. On discharge, the patient was noted to have a prolonged PR interval, which could have been caused from his beta blockade, therefore his better blocker was discontinued.  #. Community acquired pneumonia: The patient presented with a cough and a questionable pneumonia on CXR. He was broadly covered at first with vancomycin and cefepime which was later switched to cefpodoxime. The patient was never febrile, looked well, never had leukocytosis and a negative sputum culture. In hindsight, the patient might have had a viral bronchitis. 

# ___ Mechanical Aortic Valve Repair: On presentation, his INR was low at 1.8. He was started on a heparin bridge until his INR was between 2.5-3.5. He had a stable hematocrit without any overt signs of bleeding. Stool guiaics x 2 were negative and there was no obvious melena. 

# Chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine between 1.0-1.4 which he maintained throughout the hospitalization. He was continued on his home lisinopril.  # History of prosthetic heart valve endocarditis: On his previous admission, the patient was diagnosed with endocarditis from clinical criteria. No vegetations were seen on echocardiogram. While on other antibiotics for pneumonia, his doxycycline was held. He finished the course of antibiotics during his hospital stay and per infectious disease, he will need to continue lifelong suppressive doxycycline therapy.
