IMAGING: CXR ___ (Final read) 1) Increasing size of left pleural effusion which is now moderate in extent.  2) New ovoid opacity developing within the left mid lung field, which may represent a pseudotumor from fluid tracking within the fissure. 

3) Previously noted left upper lobe nodule persists, but less well distinct on the current exam. 

CHEST CT with contrast ___ 1. Left upper lobe lung nodule shown to be pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. 2. Ovoid opacity demonstrated to be pseudomass from pleural fluid in the major fissure with a small-to-moderate left and trace right pleural effusions. 3. Patulous fluid-filled esophagus with fluid in the esophagus to the upper and cervical esophagus can suggest risk of aspiration and correlation with history as well as a non-emergent barium study can be obtained if deemed clinically appropriate. 4.

 Brief Hospital Course: On admission, the patient was febrile and tachypneic with a rising lactate on admission. Initial concern was that this was due to a infected loculated effusion. This was drained by interventional radiology on ___. Gram stain was negative and cultures have been no growth from this effusion. As such, it appears unlikely that the effusion was the cause of her fevers/ SIRS. Her stool was positive for C. Diff, so this was undoubtedly contributing to her septic physiology. Also of note, she was noted to have erythema and pain around her right stump incision. There was no purulent drainage. This may have been the source of her fevers. Infectious disease was consulted and they felt that the most likely source of her fevers/cause of her presentation was the right stump wound. A plain xray was performed, which revealed concerning findings for osteomyelitis.  This was discussed with her vascular surgeon, Dr. ___ feels strongly that these findings are post-operative and does not think that the leg is infected. The decision was made to treat empirically with two weeks of vancomycin/zosyn. Please see below regarding details. 

# Fevers/SIRS: As above, the most likely source was considered to be her stump infection -- cellulitis versus deep soft tissue infection. Of note, urine and blood cultures were negative throughout her admission. She has been afebrile for the past 72 hours with only ___.  . # Complicated Effusion: This was drained by interventional radiology. As above, the gram stain was negative and cultures have been no growth. AFB stain was negative. AFB culture is pending and will need to be followed-up. Cytology was negative.  It is not clear what the cause of her effusion was. Of note, her oxygenation dramatically improved status/post drainage such that she was doing well on room air.  . # Right stump cellulitis vs deep space infection: As above, infectious disease specialists felt strongly that she has a deep space infection but vascular surgery disagreed. She was treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn, for a planned two week course, ending ___. She should have inflammatory markers monitored (CRP and ESR) as well as CBC and basic metabolic panel checked weekly. If there are issues and/or if her ESR/CRP increases, this should be reported to Dr. ___ in the infectious disease department to see if the course should be extended. She has follow-up scheduled with infectious disease; it is crucial that she be present for this appointment.  . # Clostridial difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. Diff. She was noted to have diarrhea on admission and her stool was positive for C. Diff. She was given IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. The IV flagyl can be discontinued on discharge per infectious disease. She should continue on 500 mg vancomycin  PO every six hours through ___ --> 125 mg vancomycin PO twice daily through ___ --> 125 mg vancomycin daily through ___ --> 125 mg vancomycin PO every other day thorugh ___ --> 125 mg vancomcyin PO every third day for five doses. . # Encephalopathy: likely due to infection, improved during hospital stay. She was A&Ox3 at the time of discharge. . # Anxiety: Her anxiety was severe during this admission. She had been recently changed by ___ staff from paxil to duloxetine and she felt this had exacerbated her anxiety. The duloxetine was discontinued. Psychiatry was consulted. They recommended starting remeron 7.5 mg at bedtime, which was started the night prior to discharge. She was seen by social work who felt strongly that she receive further counseling. If possible, she should follow-up with a psychiatrist and a psychologist. She also received ativan 0.5 mg as needed for anxiety. . # Essential thrombocytosis: Her hydroxyurea was held on admission given acute infection. Her platelets increased off of therapy to the 900's. Hydroxyurea was restarted two days prior to discharge. She should have her platelet count rechecked in the next several days. If her counts are increasing, hematology/oncology should be consulted.  . # PVD s/p B AKA with e/o wound infection on Rt: See above re: details of wound infection. She will need to follow-up with vascular surgery; appointment scheduled. . # H/O PICC-ASSOCIATED DVT: Given her history of PICC-associated DVT, she was started on lovenox at treatment doses.  . # AFIB: Her beta blocker was held on admission due to hypotension. She then went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. An echo had been recently checked without evidence of structural heart disease. TSH was checked and was within normal limits. She was started on a beta blocker with good control of her heart rate. She should continue on the beta blocker. Regarding anticoagulation, she is receiving lovenox, once her surgical issues are settled a discussion should be had regarding whether or not she would want to be treated with coumadin. . # PALLIATIVE CARE: Of note, Ms. ___ was apparently closely followed prior to her amputation by palliative care service, specifically ___. ___ saw her during this hospitalization as well and noted that prior to this hospitalization there was some discussion of possibly pursuing a more palliative approach, including perhaps do not hospitalize orders. This should certainly be discussed further if Ms ___ is rehospitalized in the near future. . INACTIVE ISSUES: # CAD s/p RCA stent: denying any CP, cardiac enzymes were flat. 

- continued on home on ASA - BB as above . # Hypertension: continued on beta blocker as above. . # Rheumatoid arthritis: cont home azathioprine 50mg daily & prednisone 5mg daily. . # Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine . CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - check weekly CBC/basic metabolic/ESR/CRP - consider psychiatry referral - consider starting coumadin for AFib anticoagulation - anxiety treatment and/or psychiatry referral - f/u final cultures of thoracentesis  Medications on Admission: MVI ASA 81mg qd Atenolol 50mg qd Vancomycin 125mg po q6h - last dose ___ Vitamin D Paroextine 20mg qd - plan for weaning Cymbalta 30mg qd Gabapentin 400mg qhs and 300mg tid Prednisone 5mg qd Hydroyurea 500mg bid Azathioprine 50mg qd Omeprazole 20mg qd Dilaudid ___ po q4h prn pain Folic acid Levothyroxine 100mg qd Phenergan 12.5mg po/pr q6h prn nausea Ativan 0.5mg po q8h prn anxiety
