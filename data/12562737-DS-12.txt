 Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ man with history of throat cancer and recent c-diff infection, admitted to ___ after a fall down 15 stairs with +LOC, suffering multiple injuries to the head, face, and neck. Ophtho, spine, plastics, neurosurgery, trauma all consulted in ED. Plastic surgery sutured multiple facial lacerations, and recommended sinus precautions for the facial fractures. The patient was transferred to the TSICU for close monitoring and resuscitation given his spine and neurological injuries. A bifrontal SAH was identified on CT; neurosurgery was consulted who recommended keppra x7 days and repeat head CT along with neuro checks. The patient had no focal neurologic deficits on admission. Repeat non-contrast head CT imaging showed the SAH was stable; the patient will follow up with neurosurgery 4 weeks after discharge. On ___, the patient became delerious and then developed respiratory distress, requiring intubation for AMS and airway protection. The patient developed a fever to 101.8 and was pan-cultured, started on empiric antibiotics. The patient was also noted to have a hematocrit drop to 22 with stool guaiac positive on exam, and was transfused 1 unit PRBC. The patient was hypotensive, requiring pressors. TTE was grossly normal. Stool sent for c-diff came back positive and the patient was started on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for recurrent c-diff. 

The patient was found to have an extension-type fracture at C6-C7 with evidence of instability. He also was found to have this C1 burst-type ___ fracture. Orthopedic Spine was consulted for this and, given the nature of the instability at C6-C7, in order preserve his spinal cord function, he elected to undergo surgical treatment. On HD#3 the patient underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion which the patient tolerated well. The patient was successfully extubated on POD#1. Mini-BAL cultures growing E Coli/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS, sensitive to ciprofloxacin, therefore patient started IV ciprofloxacin for this. 

Opthalmology was consulted for possible entrapment due to traumatic right orbital blowout fracture. Eye exam revealed no retrobulbar hematoma and intact EOMs. Dilation was deferred given the presence of a SAH, and patient will follow up with opthalmology once cleared by neuro-surgery.

The patient was transferred to the floor on POD#2. He was complaining of dysphagia and was evaluated by speech and swallow. Speech and swallow recommended strict NPO due to signs of aspiration; a dobhoff was placed for enteral nutrition. The patient is currently tolerating his tubefeeds at goal. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible with Physical Therapy.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating tubefeeds, out of bed to chair with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient and family received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. He was discharged to rehabillitation center per ___ recommendations. He had follow-up appointments scheduled with ACS, Spine, and Neurology.

 Discharge Instructions: Mr ___, You were admitted to ___ after falling down stairs. You sustained multiple injuries, including a complex cervical spine fracture, a traumatic bleed in your brain, a right orbital blowout, and a facial laceration. You were seen by the orthopedic spine doctors and ___ anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. You were initially monitored closely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and required intubation for delerium and respiratory distress. You were successfully extubated and stable enough to be transferred out of the ICU to the floor. You were evaluated by speech and swallow and showed signs of aspiration when you swallowed, so a tube was placed down your nose to give you nutrition until you are able to safely swallow regular food. Your vital signs are stable and you are ready to be discharged to a rehabillitation center, to regain your strength. Please note the following discharge instructions:

ACDF: You have undergone the following operation: Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion Immediately after the operation:

 Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for 2 weeks. You will be more comfortable if you do not sit in a car or chair for more than ~45 minutes without getting up and walking around.

 Rehabilitation/ Physical Therapy:

-___ times a day you should go for a walk for ___ minutes as part of your recovery. You can walk as much as you can tolerate. 

-Isometric Extension Exercise in the collar: 2x/day x ___xercises as instructed.

 Swallowing: Difficulty swallowing is not uncommon after this type of surgery. This should resolve over time. Please take small bites and eat slowly. Removing the collar while eating can be helpful  however, please limit your movement of your neck if you remove your collar while eating.

 Cervical Collar / Neck Brace: You have been given a soft collar for comfort. You may remove the collar to take a shower or eat. Limit your motion of your neck while the collar is off. You should wear the collar when walking, especially in public

 Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days. If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing. If it is dry then you can leave the incision open to the air. Once the incision is completely dry (usually ___ days after the operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a bath or pool. If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet. Call the office at that time. If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same instructions in terms of wound care.

 You should resume taking your normal home medications.

 You have also been given Additional Medications to control your pain. Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so plan ahead. You can either have them mailed to your home or pick them up at the clinic located on ___.  We are not allowed to call in narcotic (oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet) prescriptions to the pharmacy.  In addition, we are only allowed to write for pain medications for 90 days from the date of surgery.

 Follow up:       Please Call the office and make an appointment for 2 weeks after the day of your operation if this has not been done already.

 At the 2-week visit we will check your incision, take baseline x rays and answer any questions.

 We will then see you at 6 weeks from the day of the operation. At that time we will most likely obtain Flexion/Extension X-rays and often able to place you in a soft collar which you will wean out of over 1 week. 

Please call the office if you have a fever>101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, drainage from your wound, or have any questions.

Due to your facial fractures, please note the following sinus precautions: -Do Not drink with a straw. -Do Not blow your nose. -Use all medications as directed. If you develop any side effects or if you have any questions, stop the medication and call the office. -Do Not play any wind instruments. -Do Not smoke cigarettes, pipes, or cigars. -Do Not open your mouth widely. -Do Not sneeze through your nose.
