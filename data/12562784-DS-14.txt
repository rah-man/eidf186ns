 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman who had MSSA bacteremia in ___ complicated by mitral valve endocarditis and sacral and lumbar osteomyelitis, transfered here from ___ with osteo and discitis, inability to bear weight, and acute renal failure likely ___ to antibiotics and NSAID use. She was made "comfort measures only" during this hospitalization.

# Sacral and vertebral osteo with discitis Present since hospitalization in ___. Pt with severe type IV hypersensitivity reaction to Nafcillin, infx non-reponsive to Vanc, pt developed AIN on Vanc, failed treatment on Dapto. Now with severe bone damage and necrosis from infection. Othropedic and neurosurgery reviewed the case here and offered surgeries with poor prognosis and low likelihood of improving the pt's pain. Infectious disease team did not feel that other antibiotic options were available. Through a process of several family meetings, the patient was made CMO. As her clinical status was stable, the family felt ready for transfer to hospice closer to their home in ___. 

#Pain Was very difficult to control on the patient's MS contin regimen, on which she was requiring high doses of IV dilaudid to get below ___ pain. She was placed on a dilaudid PCA and was administering more than 25mg of dilaudid over each 24 hours period. With these doses of dilaudid she became quite confused and at time agitated (see below). The patient was then changed to a basal methadone regimen and began requiring much smaller doses of dilaudid. We were able to stop the PCA as the patient was not using it and her confusion cleared. She was experiencing good pain control on the basal methdone, with IV dilaudid PRN and neurontin at the time of discharge. She also experienced good response to toradol during the hospitalization, which we have continued as a PRN for severe pain.

#Confusion Occured in the context of high dose dilaudid. Patient was disorient to everything but self, at times agitated and hallucinating. We started PRN olazepine and then haldol for the agitation, though she never required very much of this as the delerium resolved with the reduction in dilaudid dose (as above). She experiences good sedative effect from the standing olanzepine at nighttime.

# Renal failure Present at arrival with Cr to 2.6, likely acute from volume depletion on chronic from AIN and home NSAID use for pain. Cr went back to baseline of 1.7, near baseline after administration of fluids. She was given toradol as we attempted to reduce the IV dilaudid dose and she had a Cr or 2.2 when stopped checking labs on ___.

# UTI Pt reported some dysuria during the hospitalization and had a positive UA. She was treated initially with Bactrim, to which she developed a rash, and then with cipro for a total of 3 days before she was made CMO an abx were stopped.

# Pressure ulcers Stage 2 sacral pressure ulcer present at arrival. Wound care bandaged these through the hospitalization. As the patient was experiencing urinary incontinence, ulcers appeared to be worsening, and bedpan use caused considerable pain, a Foley was placed on ___. This is present at the time of DC.
