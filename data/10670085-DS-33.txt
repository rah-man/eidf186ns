___ ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS: 1. Normal caliber abdominal aorta without ectasia or   stenosis. Bilateral nephrograms not well appreciated. 2. Patent bilateral iliac systems. 3. Patent left common femoral artery and profunda femoris. 4. Severe tortuosity of the left superficial femoral   artery. 5. Left popliteal artery with 2 short-segment areas of 70%   stenosis. 6. The left posterior tibial artery is occluded with no   distal reconstitution. The peroneal artery shortly   occludes after its takeoff from the TP trunk. The   anterior tibial artery is the dominant blood supply to   the foot; however, 6 cm off the anterior tibial artery   take off there is a short segment greater than 90%   stenosis as well as a 6 cm occlusion distally above the   ankle. The dorsalis pedis reconstitutes at the level of   the forefoot;   however, it is diminutive in size and is not an adequate   bypass target
