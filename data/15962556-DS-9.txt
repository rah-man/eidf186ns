IMAGING: ======== ___ Imaging LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US IMPRESSION: 1. Patent main portal vein. 2. Small volume ascites. 3. Status post cholecystectomy. Dilated common bile duct, likely related to post cholecystectomy state. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT)  IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ Imaging US INTERVENTIONAL PROCE IMPRESSION:  1. Successful ultrasound guided core-biopsy of omentum. 2. Three core biopsy samples were obtained and sent for pathology.

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities in the right midlung and left lung base most likely represent subsegmental atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. No pulmonary edema is identified. There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. Surgical clips are noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

___ CT Chest with Contrast IMPRESSION: 1. Scattered 3-4 mm pulmonary nodules are unchanged from most recent prior, and at least 2 are unchanged from ___. 2. A 1.5 cm right diaphragmatic lymph node is increased from 8 mm in ___. 3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 4. Ascites is noted in the upper abdomen.

___ US Paracentesis and Biopsy IMPRESSION: 1. Technically successful ultrasound guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis. 2. 3 L of fluid were removed and 1L was sent for requested analysis. 

   Brief Hospital Course: ___ with PMHx L breast CA s/p mastectomy, HTN, hypothyroidism, presenting as transfer from ___ for diagnostic paracentesis/hepatology consult in setting of new ascites with concern for possible peritoneal carcionomatosis in upper quadrants bilaterally. Cytology from the peritoneal fluid was consistent with adenocarcinoma, but biopsy was inconclusive. She was seen by hematology/oncology and underwent a repeat paracentesis and biopsy with plan to follow up on the results as an outpatient. She was evaluated by ___ during her stay and was discharged to rehab for weakness/deconditioning.

ACUTE ISSUES ============ # Concern for abdominal malignancy: CTA on ___ showed peritoneal carcinomatosis. Biopsy results not conclusive as above. Cytology with atypical cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma. She underwent repeat omental bx as well as diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on the day of discharge which she tolerated very well and will follow up with oncology as outpatient.

# Ascites: Presenting with 3 weeks of abdominal pain and ascites. Diagnostic paracentesis with high WBC (3408) with 24% polys (817) which is greater than the 250 cutoff for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. SAAG is 0 indicating a non-portal HTN related etiology of the ascites, likely malignancy given CT findings as above. She was treated empirically for possible SBP. Ascites cultures negative. Due to high suspicion for malignant effusion rather than SBP and the fact that malignant effusions can sometimes mimic cell counts similar to SBP, decision was made not to continue Bactrim PPX as outpatient. She had a repeat paracentesis on the day of discharge as above.

CHRONIC ISSUES ============== # Hypothyroidism: She was continued on home levothyroxine 37.5mcg daily 

# HTN: She was continued on home metoprolol succinate 100mg daily. Amlodipine 2.5mg daily was initially continued but was ultimately d/c'ed in the setting of borderline BPs.

# Anxiety: She was continued on home amitriptyline and diazepam 

# Overactive bladder: She was continued on home tolterodine 

# Primary prevention: She was continued on aspirin 81mg. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Continue to monitor for signs of increasing abdominal pain/distension. Given peritoneal carcinomatosis may need repeat therapeutic paracentesis. [ ] Patient was not started on PPX for SBP given that her suspicion of SBP was very low. Her exudative and very cellular ascitic fluid is likely malignant in nature and cultures remained negative. [ ] Patient's SBP this admission was intermittently in the 90-100s, so her home amlodipine was stopped. Continue to monitor as outpatient. [ ] The patient had been using O2 at night at home. However, in house, she was monitored off of O2 without any significant desaturations noted. Would continue to monitor and consider sleep study as needed. [ ] The patient had a positive UCx during admission without any reported urinary symptoms. She was treated with abx for possible SBP, which would have covered potential UTI anyway. [ ] Nutritional labs notable for low Vitamin A as well as borderline low zinc. Could consider starting supplementation. [ ] CEA, CA-125, and CA ___ were elevated. CA ___ WNL. Repeat omental biopsy and ascitic fluid cytology were pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed up. [ ] Chest CT notable for "1. Scattered 3-4 mm pulmonary nodules are unchanged from most recent prior, and at least 2 are unchanged from ___. 2. A 1.5 cm right diaphragmatic lymph node is increased from 8 mm in ___

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,  It was a privilege caring for you at ___ ___. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  - You came to the hospital due to new fluid build up in your stomach. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  - On imaging, we found some masses on the tissue (peritoneum) that covers some of the organs in your abdomen as well as fluid in your abdomen, some of which we removed. - Unfortunately, the fluid under the microscope did show signs of cancer, but no signs of bacteria. - You were seen by the oncology team, and they will set up an outpatient follow-up with an oncologist in ___ for you to continue your treatment. - We started you on IV antibiotics. After you completed your course of IV antibiotics, you were feeling better, and it was thought that the fluid in your abdomen was more likely due to cancer rather than infection, so your oral antibiotics were stopped. - You had a repeat procedure to remove more fluid from your abdomen and another biopsy for further testing. You will follow up these results with your oncologist.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  - Continue to take all your medicines and keep your appointments. 

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,  Your ___ Team   Followup Instructions: ___
