STUDIES

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of diffuse pulmonary metastatic disease. No focal consolidation. 

CT ___ ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Interval increase in size of 1.7 cm left frontal metastasis with increased, extensive associated vasogenic edema causing effacement of the adjacent sulci, but no midline shift. 2. New 4 mm right frontal lesion with small amount of surrounding vasogenic edema and new 6 mm right parietal lesion concerning for new metastases. 

CTA Chest ___ FINDINGS:  CHEST:  HEART AND VASCULATURE: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified to the subsegmental level without filling defect to indicate a pulmonary embolus. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection or intramural hematoma. The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits. No pericardial effusion is seen.  AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: No axillary lymphadenopathy. There is extensive bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Bulky hilar lymph nodes cause mass effect and narrowing of segmental pulmonary artery branches including the left upper lobe branch area and right upper lobe branch.  PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  LUNGS/AIRWAYS: There is extensive diffuse apical predominant bulky metastatic disease throughout the lungs. No underlying focal consolidation. Airways are patent subsegmental levels bilaterally. Mild narrowing of the right bronchus intermedius by bulky hilar lymph nodes and metastases. Airways are otherwise patent to subsegmental levels bilaterally.  BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show no abnormality.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. Nonobstructive 4 mm stone is noted in the interpolar region of the right kidney.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Small hiatal hernia. Stomach is otherwise unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. Scattered diverticula of the sigmoid and descending colons without evidence of diverticulitis are noted. The appendix is normal. There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or free air.  PELVIS:  There is approximately 5.4 x 3.2 cm mass involving the right anterolateral aspect of the bladder wall. Calcified linear projection arises from the mass and projects into the bladder lumen. Mild fat stranding around the bladder is noted. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is unremarkable. No adnexal abnormalities.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. An enlarged left external iliac node measures up to 1.5 cm. Multiple enlarged right external iliac node measures up to 1.5 cm.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5. The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  IMPRESSION:   1. Extensive, bulky apical predominant metastatic disease throughout the lungs. No underlying focal consolidation. 2. No pulmonary embolism. Bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy cause narrowing of right upper and left upper lobe pulmonary arteries branches which remain patent. 3. 5.4 cm mass at the anterolateral aspect of the right bladder wall consistent with known bladder cancer with associated bilateral external iliac lymphadenopathy. 4. No acute intra-abdominal process.

 Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE ============ ___ w/ HTN, DL, T2DM, CKD, and uroeptihelial bladder ca w/ diffuse mets (lung, brain) now on Atezolizumab C4D1 ___ and CK who presented with seizure-like episode at home (RUE shaking then unresponsiveness and eye rolling) on ___. In the ED she was found to have bulky pulmonary mets and interval increase of the L frontal met w/ edema and a new 4 mm R frontal and 6 mm R parietal lesion. She was seen by ___. She was started on dex and admitted to ___ as she was also requiring a non-rebreather. She was stabilized on 95% on 10L oximizer in NAD resting comfortably so she was transferred to oncology.

EVENTS: - ___: Admitted to ___ - ___: Transferred to Onc-Hosp, met with HCP and had GOC discussion and patient declined to make any decisions until she speaks to Dr ___ Dr ___ with her family at bedside - ___: her O2 sat dipped to ___ on 15L with movement, informed her she needs a NRB on top of the oxymizer if her goals are to cont medical care and she declined, stating she wanted to be "as least restrictive as possible" - ___: family meeting held, pt elected to enroll in hospice - ___: patient was enrolled in inpatient hospice 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ w/ HTN, DL, T2DM, CKD, and uroeptihelial bladder ca w/ diffuse mets (lung, brain) now on Atezolizumab C4D1 ___ and CK who presented with seizure-like episode at home (RUE shaking then unresponsiveness and eye rolling) on ___, found to have worsening brain mets and heavy pulmonary metastatic burden. She elected on ___ to enroll in hospice

# Goals of Care Due to the negative trajectory and heavy metastatic burden with high O2 demands, discussed with patient that her prognosis is extremely poor and after multiple family meetings, she elected to enroll in hospice ___, officially enrolled ___. 

# Acute on chronic hypoxic resp failure She has known O2 demand for which she was started on supplemental O2 at home. However now requiring high levels of O2. CTA on admission ruled out PE but did reveal extensive diffuse apical predominant bulky metastatic disease throughout the lungs as well as bulky medistinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with pulm artery branch narrowing. She continued to require high levels of O2, now 15L with destaurations to the ___ with any movement. With this trajectory, she is too critical to receive any further cancer directed therapy and elected to enroll in inpatient hospice.  # Seizure Pt had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure with eye rolling lasting ___ min followed with ~5 min recovery of her MS. ___ imaging c/w progressive brain mets. Seen by neuro-onc. Had been on keppra but she did not resume it the last few weeks PTA due to running out of her script. She was on 2 mg BID dex PTA. She has had no further grand-mals inpatient. EEG did not reveal siezure activity but final report has not been finalized. 

# Progressive Brain Mets Followed by Dr. ___ completed CK ___ to the L and R parietal mets, and two cerebellar mets. Now has progressive mets. Respiratory status precludes her safely obtaining MRI. We continued dex and keppra. 

# UTI She has dysuria, found to have GNR on urine cx. She is at risk for infections in light of the right bladder wall mass. She received CTX ___. 

# Bladder Ca Patient's oncologist is aware of admission. She is on Atezolizumab but her performance status precludes her from chemotherapy at this time. She was seen by oncology and agreed with hospice
