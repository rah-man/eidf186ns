MICRO: Blood cx x2 ___: No growth to date Sputum cx: contaminated

ECG ___: ASYMPTOMATIC AT TIME The rhythm is most likely atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response (HR 45). Occasional ventricular premature beats. Diffuse T wave flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the heart rate has significantly slowed. 

IMAGING ___ CXR HISTORY: ___ male with shortness of breath, fever. COMPARISON: ___. FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest. The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of focal consolidation. There is no effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Hypertrophic changes seen in the spine without acute osseous abnormality. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

CT Head w/o contrast ___: HISTORY: Unwitnessed fall, on Coumadin. Assess for intracranial hemorrhage. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial images obtained through the brain.  Coronal and sagittal reformations provided. COMPARISON: No prior studies available comparison. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large masses, mass-effect or acute infarcts. The ventricles and sulci are prominent with lateral and ___ ventricular dilatation appearing somewhat out of proportion to the degree of sulcal dilatation.  Findings may reflect age-related parenchymal involution, particularly in light of the absence of transependymal CSF flow.  However without prior studies for comparison cannot definitively exclude long-standing hydrocephalus. The mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. Bilateral mucous retention cysts are noted in the maxillary sinuses. No fracture identified. No soft tissue swelling noted.  IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage evident. Ventricles appear slightly dilated out of proportion to the ventricles. Findings may well reflect central volume loss due to age-related parenchymal atrophy, though communicating hydrocephalus cannot definitely be excluded. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with COPD, dCHF (TTE ___ largely normal), afib (CHADS=3, warfarin) who presented with new onset non-productive cough, dyspnea, worsened orthopnea and was found to be in decompensated heart failure with elevated BNP, crackles on exam and increased peripheral edema. His symptoms improved with diuresis and his final dry weight was ~206.5 lbs. 

#decompensated heart failure- patient has a history of heart failure and per review of his recent office visit notes he had ___ having uptitrated diuretic. The precipitant to the decompensation is likely dietary indiscretion with increased salt in his diet. He was 2lbs over his dry weight on admission. 

 While his CXR showed mild pulmonary edema it is likely that the 

combination of his COPD makes him have less reserve for decompensation with increased pulmonary edema. He felt markedly 

better with diuresis. Wt on discharge was 92.5. Nutrition was consulted to discuss low sodium diet with the patient's family. 

He was also seen by physical therapy who felt that he would benefit from home ___.  -increased bumex from 1mg po qday to 1.5mg po qday -pt will have labs drawn on ___ by ___ and sent to his PCP -___ patient to weigh self daily and to call his PCP if his weight increases by 2lbs

# COPD- he continued to require his inhalers during this admission and would sound tight on exam intermittently.  -no changes were made to his home regimen

# afib- currently in fib, rate controlled. His coumadin was continued at his home dose. His iNR on the day of discharge was 3.1. He will have his INR checked with his lytes on ___ and this will be faxed to his PCP.

# HTN- continue home regimen

# Gout- continue allopurinol

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Found to have new anemia from a few months ago. Needs PCP follow ___ colonoscopy ___ recs ___ repeat for poor prep. -Needs BP & HR trended on lower dose diltiazem -Likely needs outpatient echocardiogram to see if change in EF, WMA, LVH

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr ___, It was a pleasure taking care of ___ at ___. ___ came in with shortness of breath and cough. We believe that this was from congestive heart failure. In this condition the body builds up fluid and the heart lets it back up into the lungs, making it hard to breathe. The treatment is a diuretic that makes ___ urinate more. We gave ___ a stronger version of your home medication bumetanide (Bumex). ___ lost ___ lbs in fluid during this hospital stay and your breathing improved. 

It is important to take your home medications every day and to avoid salty food, which can cause another episode like this. We recommend that ___ weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. 

We decreased one of your medications for atrial fibrillation (diltiazem) because your heart rate was slightly slow. ___ will go home on a new dose of this medication. Otherwise your medications will stay the same. ___ should follow up with your primary care doctor after discharge.  Followup Instructions: ___
