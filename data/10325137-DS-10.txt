Chief Complaint: Pulmonary Embolus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___ Neck exploration with evacuation of hematoma and placement of closed suction drainage.

 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman who recently underwent an excision of a carotid body tumor on ___. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on POD#2.  Final pathology revealed a carotid body paraganglioma. On ___ the patient began having sudden onset of left flank pain, worse with inspiration and movement. Pain was initially mild, however progressed through the course of the day prompting her family to bring her to the ED. In the ED she was noted to be saturating 85% on room air. This improved with 2L of O2 via nasal cannula. A CTA of the chest was obtained which revealed bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli in all lobes with a question of right heart strain. The decision was made to start a heparin drip and admit the patient to the VICU for close monitoring.

Conclusions  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Preserved biventricular regional and global systolic function.  

___ Final Report CLINICAL INDICATION: ___ female with pulmonary embolus. Evaluate for deep vein thrombosis bilaterally.   COMPARISON: None available.   TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and Doppler sonograms of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal, and deep femoral veins were performed.   FINDINGS: There is a non-occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein.  Thrombi are also visualized in the right posterior tibial, right peroneal, and left peroneal veins. Augmentation was not performed due to the presence of these thrombi. Bilateral common femoral and deep femoral veins and left popliteal and posterior tibial veins appear patent.   IMPRESSION: Multiple deep vein thromboses as above.   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

 ___ CTA

 

 Final Report CLINICAL INDICATION: ___ female with left flank pain, status post recent surgery. Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.   COMPARISON: ___.   TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images through the chest were acquired before and after administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal, sagittal, and oblique reformatted images were reviewed.   FINDINGS: There are bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli affecting all lobes of the lungs. Symmetric bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis; however, early infarcts are also a possibility. The interventricular septum is flat with slight outward right ventricular wall bowing, suggesting early right ventricular strain. The main pulmonary arteries are patent. The aorta is normal in caliber and contour.   Left upper lobe bronchiectasis is again noted and is similar-appearing compared to prior. A large calcification in the left prevascular region is likely a calcified lymph node and is unchanged compared to prior.   This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.  The minimal visualized portions of the liver, spleen and bowel are unremarkable.   Note is made of a thoracic vertebral body hemangioma.   IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli affecting all lobes of the lungs. 2. Signs suggestive of early right ventricular strain, consider correlating with echocardiogram. 3. Bibasilar consolidations which likely represent either atelectasis or early infarcts.    The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  

 Brief Hospital Course: On ___ The patient presented to the ED with left flank pain which was worse with inspiration and movement. CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was started on heparin drip and an echo was obtained. Bilateral lower extremity duplex was obtained which showed a non-occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein and right posterior tibial, right peroneal and left peroneal veins. Hypercoagulable work-up initiated.

On POD #2 the site of the left neck carotid tumor excision incision was noted to have a new palpable hematoma. The decision was made to take the patient emergently to the Operating Room where she underwent a neck hematoma evacuation. She tolerated the procedure without complications. A JP drain was left in place post op. Transferred in stable condition to the Vascular step down. Transitioned to a heparin and Coumadin bridge with close monitoring for bleeding and hematoma. 

On POD #3 the patient was closely monitored and continued on anticoagulation. Factor V Leiden results were negative. 

___ The patient was cleared by Physical therapy for home. She was continued on a heparin and Coumadin bridge. Received first dose of Coumadin on ___. On ___ the JP was removed. 

___ The patient was in stable condition. INR was therapeutic (2.0) and the decision was made to discharge the patient home. She will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. His office has agreed to monitor the patient's Coumadin level. She will be discharged home with ___ for lab draws.
