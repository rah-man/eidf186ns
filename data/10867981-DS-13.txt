 Name: ___          Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending: ___.  Chief Complaint: S/p Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: ___ year old female with history of Alzheimer's dementia who report idly fell once yesterday morning was taken to ___ and sent home without being Scanned. Per husband's report patient was hallucinating all night and he was woken by her falling again and hitting her head on the night stand. She was awake at the time EMS arrived, she was taken to ___, a CT of the head was obtained and after her mental status started to declined and she was intubated and transferred to ___ for further care with finding on a left frontal temporal SDH.

Upon arrival to our ED at 8 am patient was hypotensive, hypothermic and hypoxic, received two units of PRBC and three liters of fluids prior to being hemodynamically stable for CT and required intubation in the ED for airway protection  Past Medical History: Alzheimers dementia  Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Gen: Intubated/Sedated Neuro: 1.5 cm nonreactive pupils. Pulm: CTAB CV: Abd soft, NTND Ext: No evident injury DRE: normal tone, no gross blood.  Pertinent Results: CT Head ___ Substantial left subdural hematoma over the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes appears acute on chronic, and enlarged compared to study performed approximately three hours prior. The extent of midline shift, most likely subfalcine and possibly uncal herniation is also increased. There is intraventricular blood, and dilation of the right lateral ventricle, compatible with degree of ventricular trapping. 2. Left frontal/periorbital soft tissue contusions, with underlying facial fractures, better characterized on CT of the facial bones performed earlier at an outside hospital. 3. Hyperdense opacification of the left maxillary sinus, compatible with hemorrhage.  4. Vascular calcifications and sequelae of chronic small vessel infarctions. 

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient was seen in the emergency room and was already intubated for airway protection. At the time of admission to the TSICU the patient had fixed and nonreactive pupils. A CT head was obtained that demonstrated a large left subdural hematoma as well as multiple facial fractures. She was hypotensive on arrival, but this resolved w/ administration of 2uPRBCs and IVF. The family was made aware of her poor prognosis and the patient was made DNR/DNI, but the current level of support was maintained. Neurosurgery was consulted and determined that operative intervention would be futile, so supportaive care was maintained. The remainder of her CTs were negative for acute injury with the exception of a single L 6th rib fx. Her systolic blood pressures were maintained under 140mmHg, and this required intermittent nicardipine drip. A dilantin load was given for seizure prophylaxis. Om HD 4 since the patient was still no extubatable in regard to her neurological function, she was started on TFs for nutritional support. She was following commands at this time. On HD 7 the patient failed a trial of extubation, and trach/peg were addressed with the family. On ___ the patient had failed to progress neurologically and was made CMO. She was extubated at 1630 and on ___ at 0415 was pronounced.
