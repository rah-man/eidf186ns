She is admitted for weakness and decreased appetite in the setting of the antibiotics and is now feeling better. The patient's son was at the bedside throughout her admission, and was updated frequently on her medical course.

Active issues: # Deconditioning and weakness: No focal reversible etiology identified. She has responded to oral fluids and supplements and ___ evaluations suggest rehab for deconditioning and ongoing therapy. Her labs do not suggest an etiology of her weakness. Supplements were started for recent decreased oral intake.

# Recent UTI: She completed her treatment, with 3 days ciprofloxacin. No evidence symptomatically of a new infection. Notes decreased appetite began in this context and is slowly improving.

# Hypertension: Son reports labile BPs are typical for the patient, although she is slightly above her typical levels in the 130s-170s SBP. She did not have evidence of volume overload, and was on her home BP regimen during her admission. Given the patient's lack of symptoms of either volume overload or hypertension, we suggested seeing how her blood pressure adjusts itself as she heals. If her BP remains sustained above 180s, she would benefit from further treatment, potentially with an additional diuretic or anti-hypertensive.

Chronic issues: # ___ edema, chronic improved some during admission. No DVT on US in ED. Son notes that HCTZ has a role in treating her ___ edema.

# Hypokalemia and hyponatremia recently, not now. Sodium stable on HCTZ current regimen. Would consider alternative agent if sodium remains an issue, given prior hyponatremia reported.

# Hypothyroidism-continue synthoid

# Hyperlipidemia-continue statin and asa

# Diet controlled DM-Did not require directed therapy
