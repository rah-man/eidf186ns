This is complicated by a fall off her bed and further confounded by a recent change in mentation this week.

CT C-SPINE ___  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.  Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed above. 

CT HEAD ___ IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.  2. Stable left scalp nodule is unchanged since ___ and may be a sebaceous cyst. 3. Fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses may reflect acute sinusitis.  

___ CT ___: Large amount of stool in the sigmoid colon which is distended with transition to more normal caliber at the distal sigmoid where there is apparent bowel mass. Proximally the sigmoid appears mildly inflamed with wall thickening and stranding. There is trace free fluid throughout the abdomen but more prominently focused in the left lower quadrant. Direct visualization of sigmoid mass is recommended. Also, 5mm left lower lobe lung nodule can be followed up in 12 months, unless patient has risk factors for lung malignancy then follow-up in ___ months is recommended.  MRI ___ PELVIS W/O CONTRAST 1. Findings consistent with active sigmoid colitis. No sigmoid mass identified. 2. A 1.6 x 1.0 cm structure adjacent to the left internal iliac ___ represent a benign left ovarian mass, such as fibroma or an enlarged left internal iliac lymph node.  Recommended follow-up pelvic ultrasound in 3 months after the acute colitis resolves to better characterize this abnormality.  3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid. 

FLEX SIG ___ At 30cm the sigmoid colon was very tortuous with a significant amount of solid stool making it difficult to traverse, despite multiple attempts. The mucosa in this area was slightly hyperemic however otherwise normal appearing. No mass was found. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 30cm

DISCHARGE LABS:

___ 07:20AM BLOOD WBC-7.2 RBC-3.12* Hgb-9.3* Hct-29.8* MCV-96 MCH-29.8 MCHC-31.2 RDW-13.3 Plt ___ ___ 07:20AM BLOOD Glucose-111* UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-136 K-4.1 Cl-102 HCO3-26 AnGap-12  Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ w/hx of diverticulitis now p/w new onset lower abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and anorexia for several days found to inflammation on imaging likely ___ to colitis.

#ABDOMINAL PAIN: Patient presented with lower abdominal pain (left lower quadrant worse than right), nausea, diarrhea, and anorexia for several days in the setting of crampy pain in same region for several months. Although patient has history of diverticulitis treated with antibiotics, what was more concerning was the finding of a new mass in the sigmoid colon with a lung nodule on CT. She also had systemic symptoms of weight loss/change in appetite for months that raised concern for malignancy. Initial differential included GI malignancy, diverticulitis, and infectious vs ischemic colitis. Patient was started on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for diverticulitis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy ___ could not get clear view due to tortuosity. MRI showed what what likely an inflammatory process secondary to colitis rather than diverticulitis. No mass, phlegmon, or abscess was seen. Colonoscopy was deferred to outpatient due to current level of inflammation. Upon discharge patient's abdominal pain had resolved and she was tolerating regular diet. She will continue her oral cipro and flagyl for a fourteen day course, stop date ___.

#FALL: Patient presented after fall where she bumped her head.  Per husband and patient this was mechanical. CT head ruled out bleed and CT c-spine ruled out fracture.

#ANEMIA: Per records patient was previously worked up for hemachromatosis (found to be negative) due to family history and abnormal iron studies. Here patient's hematocrit dropped from 31 to 24.7. This was most likely dilutional due to IVF. Iron studies showed low serum iron, low transferrin, low TIBC, high ferritin - so this could also be a mixed picture of iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease. Patient was started on ferrous sulfate supplements. Stool guiac ___ was negative and pt denied any bleeding. At discharge Hct had increased to 29.8 and had no clinical symptoms of anemia.   #HYPONATREMIA: Patient presented with serum sodium 125, though this was a hemolyzed sample. Hyponatremia was most likely secondary to poor PO intake and dehydration. Given the presence of the lung nodule, another possibility was para-neoplastic process of SIADH. Serum sodium increased at a reasonable pace with IVF and by discharge was 139. 

___: Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3 and patient presented with creatinine 1.6. This was most likely secondary to dehydration. All medications were renally dosed and creatinine improved with IVF to 1.0.  #LEG WEAKNESS: Patient reported having leg weakness for a year or two. Worse when trying to get up out of a chair or walking up the stairs. Thyroid function was tested and was normal. CK was elevated. One possibility is that this could represent a more sinister process of polymyositis related to bowel malignancy. However, no clear mass was seen on MRI (colonscopy will be done as outpatient). Physical therapy worked with patient and recommended rehab upon discharge.

#COAGULOPATHY. Patient presented with elevated ___ and PTT. This could have been due to factor deficiency vs factor inhibitor, and 1 to 1 mixing study revealed failure to correct with normal plasma, suggesting factor inhibitor. Lupus anticoagulant returned positive. However, this test also results in a number of false positives and it was recommended to repeat in 12 weeks (see transitional issues). Patient denied any known history of blood clots, however did have one miscarriage. No concern for thrombosis at discharge. Patient will have close hematology/oncology follow up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES (discussed over the phone with patient's PCP): []please ensure antibiotics continued until ___ []pt is scheduled for colonoscopy and biopsy in four weeks after inflammation subsides for question GI malignancy, please follow-up []heme outpatient appointment for f/u lupus anticoagulant []pelvic ultrasound in 3 months, as pelvic MRI w/o contrast showed either enlarged lymph node or benign mass on left ovary []please consider screening mammogram for patient []please f/u on lung nodule with imaging in ___ months []patient's anti-hypertensives were all held in-house, please consider re-starting one by one as patient becomes normotensive. []please check CBC on ___ as patient's crit transiently dropped whilst in patient to 24. On day of discharge crit was 29.8. []40 lb weight loss, question of slow functional decline given reports of worsening dementia vs pseudodementia vs malignancy []pt requests medical information in the future goes primarily to husband, daughter ___ (daughter ___ less involved)  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
