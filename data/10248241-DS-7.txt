A CT-duided liver biopsy at OSH was not performed given suboptimal visualization of the lesion. However evaluation of the lesion by radiology here demonstrated it to meet OPTN criteria for HCC; therfore it did not require a biopsy. 

Today, he underwent TACE via left radial artery access with CT-guided chemoembolization delivered to the segment 6 lesion, followed by gel foam. He had headache post procedure, given oxycodone.

 Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of CKD stage 3, diabetes type 2 complicated by retinopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, admitted following elective trans-arterial chemoembolization, course complicated by gait instability and hyperglycemia, resolved and able to be discharged home

# Hepatocellular Carcinoma status post TACE - On ___, patient underwent chemoembolization of segment VI lesion. His discharge LFTs were ALT 118, AST 104, AP 68, Tbili 1.3. Could consider recheck at follow-up to ensure normalization to his baseline

# Type 2 diabetes complicated by hyperglycemia - Patient course notable for post-procedure hyperglycemia. Patient also reported chronically elevated fingersticks at home, which his wife attributed to poor dietary compliance. Given ___, patient remained in the hospital for 1 extra day for glucose control optimization. No modifications were necessary to home regimen--just dietary. Continued home insulin regimen and patient and wife received counseling from nutritionist re: diabetic diet. ___ < 180 prior to discharge. Continued home ___ (received glargine while inpatient), standing humalog and glipizide. Held metformin x 72 hours post embolization.

# Thrombocytopenia - During this admisison, patient noted to have thrombocytopenia. On review of prior records from ___ and ___, it appears this has been noted previously.  Suspect this is secondary to his chronic liver disease. Plt at discharge were 58k. 

# Hypertension # Hyperlipidemia Continued Lisinopril, statin, HCtz 

# Depression - Continued Venlafaxine 

Transitional Issues - Reported poorly controlled fingersticks at home as high as 300; here immediately post-procedure he was hyperglycemic, but improved to < 180 after re-initiation of his home regimen; was seen by nutritional counselor given concern for dietary compliance at home--would consider further dietary counseling as an outpatient; - Recommended to hold metformin x 72 hours after his TACE - Thrombocytopenia noted during admission, thought to relate to his chronic liver disease; would consider recheck at follow-up (discharge platelets = 58) - Discharged with rolling walker and home physical therapy - Scheduled for ___ and ___ follow-up - LFTs at discharge were ALT 118, AST 104, AP 68, Tbili 1.3; could consider recheck at follow-up to ensure normalization to his baseline
