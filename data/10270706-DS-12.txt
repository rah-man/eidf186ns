Chief Complaint: hypoglycemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none.  History of Present Illness: Ms ___ is an ___ year old ___ speaking female, who presents from ___ (nursing home) for hypoglycemia. 

Around noon on day of admission, staff at her nursing home noticed she had become less responsive and was unable to move her extremities. Finger stick was 96. She had just been administered SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Given concern for a stroke, paramedics were called. When they arrived, her glucose was apparently low and glucagon was administered. An IO was placed in the left leg and an amp of D50 was administered.  She was brought to the ED, where blood sugar was noted to be 16.  She received another amp of D50. Glucose improved transiently but again came down to 40. Intravenous dextrose (D10W) was started. She had improvement, but several additional hypoglycemic episodes. 

Her white count was noted to be 15,000, and a lactate was 4.0.  Her blood pressure remained normotensive. Her temperature was 99.6. She had a CT head and abdomen/pelvis which revealed no infectious focus. She does have ulcers of dorsum of both lower extremities which were treated with keflex 2 weeks prior; these are dry and non-seeping. Recently she also had a diagnosis of DVT after a hospitalization in ___ for left hip fracture, for which an ORIF was performed. She was started on coumadin and completed a course of coumadin on ___. Since then, she has been transitioned to SC heparin for prophylaxis. There is no history of hypoglycemia prior to this episode; she has no known history of diabetes; there is no reason to suspect surreptious insulin use. She does not use ___ herbal medications. She denies dry skin, fevers, changes in bowel movements. She has lost 10 lbs of weight while at the nursing home following the hip fracture and surgery. Review of systems otherwise negative. 

Endocrine was consulted who recommended several lab tests, include C-peptide, sulfonylurea level, beta-hydroxybutyrate.

She was admitted to the MICU given her recurrent hypoglycemia for management and further workup. At time of transfer, her vitals revealed a HR of 88, a temp of 99.6, SaO2 of 98% on RA.

___: Plain films of feet: FINDINGS: AP, lateral, and oblique views of the feet are obtained. There are mild degenerative changes. There are no bony erosions to suggest osteomyelitis or periostitis. However, bone scan or MRI would be more sensitive for this finding if clinically indicated. 

Studies: CT head IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process based on this somewhat limited exam.  2. Significant fecal loading extending all the way to the rectum. 3. Compression fracture of L3 of unknown age. 

CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process based on this somewhat limited exam.  2. Significant fecal loading extending all the way to the rectum. 3. Compression fracture of L3 of unknown age. 

CT head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

Plain films pelvis: IMPRESSION: Status post ORIF of a left proximal femoral fracture without evidence of hardware complications. No new acute fracture noted. 

 CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old ___ female with acute, recurrent hypoglycemia in the setting of leukocytosis, lactatemia, low grade temperatures, and potential infectious focus. 

# Hypoglycemia: Pt presented from nursing home with severe hypoglycemia to ___. Despite several doses of D50 blood sugars remained ___ at ED. She does not have history of DM, does not take insulin or hypoglycemic agents, and does not have history of hypoglycemia. She was started on D10 drip which was continued in ICU untiil sugars were consistently in 100s. Drip was stopped and sugars remained in normal range. She was tolerating po without difficulty. Endocrine was curbsided in ED who recommended sending pro-insulin, sulfonylurea, C-peptide, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. TSH and cortisol were checked given concern for panhypopituitarism. AM cortisol was wnl; TSH was low but free T4 within normal range. There was some suspicion that she ___ have accidentally been administered insulin at rehab, which the rehab denied. Possible infectious causes were investigated but CXR and U/A were unremarkable.  Blood cultures were sent, which are both no growth to date. EKG was unremarkable. Only possible source of infection were ulcers on dorsum of both feet which were treated per below.

While on the floor, the patient's blood sugars were checked every four hours initially, then spaced out to q8h. The patient maintained her sugars between 85-200. After discharge, it was found that the patient's c-peptide levels were elevated. The patient's grand daughter and the patient's PCP were both contacted, as there is concern that the patient ___ have an insulinoma. The patient was scheduled for an appt to see an endocrinologist at ___ on ___. The patient's grand daughter was cautioned re: the signs and symptoms of hypogylcemia and instructed to give the patient juice and immediately bring her to the ED for evaluation. 

# leukocytosis: The patient presented with an elevated white count and lactate; an ifectious work-up was negative, except for the ulcers on her feet b/l (see below). It was thought that her white count could have been due to hypoglycemic state. She was ultimately started on bactrim/keflex for presumed cellulitis.  However, on transfer to the floor, the decision was made to d/c antibiotics, as the patient remained afebrile. The patient is also s/p ORIF--> there was a thought of posisbly having infected hardware in the setting of elevated CRP/ES; however, plain film of the hip was negative for any acute hardware complications.  Her CRP and ESR should be repeated as an outpatient.

# Cellulitis: Pt had an ulcer on dorsum of each feet with dried blood; no active purulent draiange. While in the MICU, it was noted that the surrounding skin was erythematous and warm to touch. After lactate had normalized, she was started on bactrim and keflex for cellulitis. Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) were checked which were elevated.

While on the floor, the patient was seen by podiatry who recommended wet to dry dressing for the R ulcer, and collagenase for ulcer. A plain film of her feet were both negative for osteomyelitis or any fractures. Because the patient was afebrile with white count normalizing, the patient's antibiotics were discontinued. It was thought that her initial elevated white count could be a stress response to the state of hypoglycemia. . # foot ulcers: While in the MICU, it was initially thought there was some surrounding erythema that could be consistent with cellulitis around each foot ulcer, and the patient was started on Bactrim/Keflex.  On the floor, the patent had plain films of her feet which were normal. Podiatry was consulted and recommended collagenase to the L ulcer and wet to dry dressings to the R foot ulcer. Ultimately, the patient's Bactrim/Keflex were both stopped. . # Dementia: The patient was continued on her home exelon.  . # Osteoporosis: The patient is s/p hip fracture complicated by DVT s/p 3 months of coumadin. The patient was continued on heparin SC while in patient, as well as calcium and Vitamin D. 

# HTN: The patient is on lasix at home. While in house the patient's Lasix was held. She was instructed to restart her Lasix as an outpatient. This should also be followed up as an outpatient. 

Transitional Issues: - The patient was found to have an elevated C-peptide, which suggests that there was endogenous insulin secretion; she will have to have an endocrine evaluation, including imaging, to assess for an insulinoma. The patient's PCP was contacted with this information, as was the patient's grand daughter ___.  The patient was made a follow-up appt with ___ for further work up of this insulinoma on ___. The patient's granddaughter was also cautioned about the signs/symptoms of hypoglycemic events and that fast administration of sugar is necessary, as well as immediately calling an ambulance and bringing the patient to the emergency room for evaluation. 

- The patient will need to have a CRP/ESR repeated as an outpatient. 

- The patient is not currently on a bisphosphonate in the setting of her recent hip fracture. This is something that should be followed up as an outpatient.
