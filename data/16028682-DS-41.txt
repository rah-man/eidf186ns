 Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old male with medical history pertinent for CAD s/p CABG, Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 40%), afib s/p PPM not on coumadin who now presented with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and fever at ___ after recent treatment for presumed LLL Aspiration PNA. . #. Pneumonia, HCAP: The patient presented from ___ with report of fever to 101, increased O2 requirement and R>L effusion ___ distribution where patient recently had a known pneumonia with rise ___ leukocytosis. Although pleural effusion may be from multiple etiologies (see below), given fever and episode of hypotension ___ ED, concern was for evolution of PNA with possible parapneumonic effusion/empyema. Coverage was broadened for HCAP given recent hospitalization and potential evolution despite therapy with Quinolone/Flagyl (since ___ with Vanc/Ceftazidime (___). IP was consulted and performed thoracentesis on ___ with 1.2 L of serous fluid withdrawn.  This fluid was consistent with a transudate, likely from pts poor cardiac function/chronic biventricular CHF. A midline was placed on ___ for pt to complete a 7 day course of Vanc/Ceftazidime. Of note, bronchoscopy on ___ did reveal erythema and friability of the LLL, consistent with a recent infection. . #.

It was felt his pleural effusions are likely due to CHF and LV failure/severe MR. ___ was restarted on his carvedilol, torsemide (at 20 mg daily, titrated up to 20 mg bid prior to discharge), and lisinopril at 2.5 mg daily (titrated up to 10 mg daily prior to discharge). Given digoxin level of 0.3, his digoxin was increased to daily. His digoxin level should be repeated ___ 5 days. His lisinopril and torsemide should be titrated up to keep creatinine at approx 2.0 and SBP ___ ___ (he has been on torsemide 40 mg twice daily ___ the past). Cr was 1.5 prior to discharge. Patient does not clinically appear grossly volume overloaded although BNP is elevated. Best dry weight is ___ 140s up to 150 per OMR, currently pt weighs 145 lbs. Goal per cardiology is to get SBP ___ the ___, and allow for pt dizziness/lightheadedness. Per cardiology, pt will likely need to be mildly lightheaded with his blood pressure ___ order to optimize cardiac function, and it will be a delicate balance. Pt has follow up with Dr. ___ ___ clinic scheduled for next month. . # LLL Lung collapse: Pt had LLL collapse, felt to be due to either mucoid impaction (noted on CT scan) vs. the pleural effusion. After thoracentesis there was not much expansion, so pt was taken for bronchoscopy on ___. This revealed R mainstem, RML, RLL white secretions (?barium aspiration) and LLL edematous meucosa with friability likely due to pneumonia. This did not result ___ any lung expansion ___ the LLL on follow up CXR. . #. Fever: Patient with fever to 101.0 reported at ___ with rise ___ leukocytosis concerning for infectious process on admission. Afebrile while here. UA with WBC but ___ setting of > 50RBC. Initial urine culture here grew coag neg. staph, but on the following day was negative. Suspect contamination/colonization given pt has had a foley ___. Regardless, pt is being treated with Vancomycin for his PNA. C diff was negative. Pts pleural effusion was not consistent empyema and culture was negative for infection. He will be treated as per above for HCAP. . #. Hypotension: Patient with hypotension with SBP ___ high ___ ___ ED, recovered to 120 with 500cc NS bolus x 2. Unclear etiology for this drop ___ BP. Lactate reassuring at 1.6. Cardiac enzymes neg x2.

CAD s/p bypass graft: Patient with history of known CAD s/p CABG, last admission Trop mildly elevated at .10 x 3 thought secondary to demand. CE added to ER admission labs revealing Trop .05 -> .04. ASA was continued. Initially due to hypotensive episode pts coreg and lisinopril were held, but these were restarted. . #. Urinary Retention/Hematuria: Patient had a traumatic foley placement last admission with urethral injury requiring CBI for gross hematuria. Patient had clear urine here. Plan was for outpatient follow up with urology on ___ to have foley removed, but pt was inpatient. While here, pts foley was removed and pt was given a voiding trial on ___. He was retaining from 500-850 cc ___ his bladder, so foley was replaced again. Would repeat voiding trial again ___ several days. Per pt, he did not have any urinary difficulty/BPH symptoms prior to his last admission (with traumatic foley placement). . #. Diabetes Mellitus II controlled with complication: ___ controlled on admission, history of vascular disease. Last admission patient had hypoglycemic episodes on half-dose Glyburide, maintained on insulin sliding scale with plan to restart when taking reliable POs and tolerated.
