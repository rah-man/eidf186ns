Radiology Report CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT Study Date of ___ 1:40 ___ CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C; CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT  Clip # ___  

 FINDINGS:   There is no displaced fracture.   There is some enlargement and indistinctness of the left gluteus maximus, medius, and the left piriformis muscles, likely consistent with components of hematoma and edema. There is also a mild amount of subcutaneous fat infiltration within the left buttock subcutaneous fat.   Mild degenerative changes are identified in bilateral sacroiliac joints as well as in the posterior facets of the visualized lower lumbar spine.   IMPRESSION:   No evidence of displaced fracture. Presumed edema and hematoma in left gluteal region. 

 Brief Hospital Course: 1. Left Gluteal Hematoma: The patient developed a hematoma on the left gluteal region after the fall. He was hemodynamically stable but hematocrit dropped from a baseline of 44% to 30.1%. On the day of discharge, his hematocrit had stabilized to 31.6. He was not given any blood products and denied any symptoms of chest pain or anginal equivalents. His plavix was stopped at this admission. His pain was managed with tylenol and PRN oxycodone.  He should follow-up with his primary care physician to recheck his hematocrit. Surgery was made aware but did not recommend evacuation of the hematoma. A visiting nurse ___ recheck his hematocrit on ___. .  2. Fall: The fall was likely to be mechanical, however the patient reported symptoms likely mechanical, but reported vague symptoms of a TIA as per HPI, so a carotid duplex was obtained which was negative of any stenosis. Plain x-rays and a CT were negative for any fractures. A fasting lipid panel was done which showed a total cholesteral of 116, LDL of 55 and HDL of 42. It was unlikely that this fall was related to a TIA. It was most likely mechanical. A home safety evaluation will be done. . 3. CAD The patient denied symptoms of chest pain or angina during this admission. He was continued on his aspirin, b-blocker and statin. He was scheduled for an elective catheterization on ___ which was cancelled due to risk of bleeding with anticoagulants used during the procedure. The patient was monitored on telemetry without any events. He should follow-up with his cardiologist to reschedule the cardiac catheterization. 

.  4. Gout Probenecid was continued. . 5. GERD Pt's home dose of PPI was continued. . 6. BPH Pt's outpatient meds were continued. In addition, a bladder scan was obtained due to symptoms of urinary urgency, showing a residual volume of 72ml and a mildly enlarged prostate. .  7. Chronic sinusitis Outpatient medications continued. . 8. Fluids and nutrition: Pt was mildly volume depleted on admission with a creatinine of 1.3 (baseline 1.1) and dry mucous membranes. He was given 1 L of NS and was put on a low salt cardiac diet. His creatinine returned to 1.1 on the day of discharge. . 9. Hospital Prophylaxis: Pt was given SC heparin and a PPI. . 10. Discharge: Pt was discharged home in good condition.
