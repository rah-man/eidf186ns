#Transaminitis - hepatocellular pattern and RUQ pain is consistent acute hepatitis.

# Cholelithiasis: likely the source of her episodic RUQ pain, also could explain transient biliary obstruction/transaminitis - Surgery (ACS) team feels she would likely benefit from CCY, but feel that her current asthma signs/sx's make her a poor candidate to have this done during this hospitalization. They will f/u with her in clinic and plan for elective CCY once her asthma is under better control. [] needs preoperative pulmonary optimization [] has f/u scheduled in General Surgery clinic

#Chest Pain #Upper Epigastric Pain #Nausea/Vomiting/Abdominal Pain Differential broad initially, but most likely gallbladder stone that may have passed vs. acute hepatitis. Considered ACS given cardiac history but troponins neg x3, EKG stable and CP resolved. CTA w/ no e/o PE or aortic dissection. Does have substantial stool/constipation possibly contributing to her pain.  -bowel regimen: docusate, senna, Miralax -added dulcolax PO/PR PRN for ongoing constipation -constipation resolved with this regimen -low dose oxycodone PRN abdominal pain (since Tylenol and NSAIDs not an option in setting of possible DILI and Tramadol is listed as allergy)

#HTN: held home BP meds I/s/o poor PO intake and lower BPs initially -held home lisinopril 10 mg daily in setting of possible DILI during hospitalization, resumed on discharge -resumed home HCTZ on day of discharge given BP increasing

# OSA - CPAP at night during hospitalization - have emailed Dr. ___ Dr. ___ to alert them to issue of patient without functioning CPAP - I suspect that untreated OSA contributes to several things which she has chronically, including insomnia and headache [] Needs assistance obtaining functional CPAP for home use

# Headache - mild but persistent - avoiding Tylenol ___ transaminitis - has Tramadol allergy - do not want to send out on oxycodone due to risk of respiratory depression (and potentially worsening OSA) - will give Rx for very low dose (200 mg) ibuprofen up to TID (total #10 tabs) for her to take PRN headache

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for chest pain. We did an ultrasound that showed gallstones, which may have been the source of your pain, nausea, and vomiting. Your liver was also temporarily inflamed as a result of either a passed gallstone or possibly one of your medications. You underwent an MRI of the abdomen, which showed gallstones in your gallbladder and cystic duct, but no evidence of obstruction of your bile ducts.

For your intermittent episodes of right-sided abdominal pain (lasting ___ minutes), we suspect this is from the presence of gallstones (called "symptomatic cholelithiasis"). The surgery doctors recommend that ___ have your gallbladder surgically removed once your asthma is under better control. In the meantime, please avoid fatty, fried food in your diet and stay well hydrated. Please plan to follow-up in general surgery clinic in ___ weeks to be re-evaluated for possible surgery. If you develop right-sided abdominal pain that does not go away for more than an hour, or is associated with fever, shaking chills, vomiting, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin), please seek immediate medical attention.

For your liver inflammation, we do not know for certain 1) if this was caused by a medication, and 2) if so, which medication it was. We have stopped one of your home medications: atorvastatin (Lipitor). Please do NOT resume taking atorvastatin (Lipitor) until told to do so by Dr. ___. Please plan to have your liver labs rechecked in ~___.

For your asthma, you were treated with continuation of your prednisone taper. You are going to take 20 mg of prednisone each day for the next 2 days, then take 10 mg daily until you see Dr. ___, NP in pulmonology clinic.

It was a pleasure caring for you and we wish you a full and speedy recovery.

Sincerely, The ___ Medicine Team  Followup Instructions: ___
