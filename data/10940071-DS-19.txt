==================== PATHOLOGY ==================== BREAST, MASTECTOMY W/O LYMPH NODES  ___ ___ - PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: ==================================== Breast Surgery Hospital Course: ==================================== The patient presented as a same day admission for surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room on ___ for right total mastectomy with right sentinel node biopsy, which the patient tolerated well. For full details of the procedure please see the separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The patient was started on a regular diet and oral medications. The patient's home medications were continued throughout this hospitalization, except her Plavix and aspirin which were held for surgical purposes. On ___ the pt had an episode of chest pain and elevated blood pressure, labs were drawn (please refer to lab results section) and an EKG done which showed a previous LBBB already known from her history. Cardiology was consulted and after evaluating the patient recommended repeating troponins x2 (negative) and said chest pain was not likely of cardiac etiology. Incidentally, the patient was found the have a moderate to severe hyponatremia (Na: 117) that was initially managed with increased IVF. Due to difficulty to manage, medicine was consulted and the patient was transferred to medicine for further optimization. 

==================================== ___ Course: ==================================== # Hyponatremia: initially due to components of both hypovolemia and inappropriate ADH. Think due in large part to severe post-operative pain. Initially did not respond to IVF and urine lytes showed inappropriately elevated urine Osm and urine Na.  However, free water restriction did not help, and patient reported feeling LH and dizzy with walking. Orthostatics were positive. AM cortisol was wnl. TSH was not suggestive of HYPOnatremia. So a repeat fluid bolus challenge was given. Orthostatics improved, symptoms improved, and repeat urine lytes demonstrated normalization (ADH suppressed, and Na < 20). Serum sodium subsequently improved and was up to 128 on the day of discharge, with the patient feeling well, mentating well, and tolerating normal diet. Plan for repeat serum sodium check with PCP on ___ (3 days after discharge) to ensure complete resolution.

# Hypertension: the primary team at the time, the Breast Surgery team, initially consulted cardiology dur to severe HTN and palpitations. Cardiology advised increasing enalapril to 20 mg PO BID, which was done. Patient's pain gradually improved, and with this increase in enalapril, BP gradually improved. On day prior to discharge, she had significant hypertension prior to AM meds, but BP the remainder of the day was well controlled. Same on the day of discharge. Would advise repeat BP check with PCP on upcoming appointment and further adjustment if needed. On discharge her BP regimen will be:   - enalapril 20 mg PO BID (increased from home regimen)   - bisoprolol 10 mg PO daily (home med, was on atenolol here because bisoprolol not on formulary) If BP still not optimized at that time, would be reasonable to have her see her cardiologist, Dr. ___ the next ___ weeks for further management.

# Invasive ductal carcinoma s/p R mastectomy w/ SLNB - Tramadol PRN while inpatient. Tylenol or motrin PRN pain at home - drain management per surgery recommendations - outpatient Breast surgery f/u as scheduled

# CAD - continued aspirin, statin, beta blocker, ACEi on discharge # Sick sinus s/p PPM

# DVT ppx: HSQ BID
