IMAGING: MRCP ___: IMPRESSION:   1. No choledocholithiasis or focal pancreatic mass. 2. The cystic duct inserts very low on the common hepatic duct, at the level of the pancreatic head. 3. Mild left hepatic lobe biliary ductal dilatation persists.  No obstructing lesion detected. Pneumobilia is likely related to reported recent ERCP. 4. Cholelithiasis, including a 1.4 cm gallbladder neck stone, without evidence of cholecystitis. 5. Subcentimeter pancreatic tail cystic lesions likely reflect side branch IPMNs. Given lesion size and patient age, recommend pancreatic cyst follow-up MRI in ___ year. 6. 3.4 cm right adrenal adenoma. 7. Mild hepatic steatosis. 8. Trace right pleural effusion.  RECOMMENDATION(S): Subcentimeter pancreatic tail cystic lesions likely reflect side branch IPMNs. Given lesion size and patient age, recommend pancreatic cyst follow-up MRI in ___bd/Pelv wo contrast ___  Impression:  1. Cholelithiasis  2. Apparent biliary duct dilation in the left lobe of the liver. A central obstructing mass is not excluded. Correlation with the liver function tests could be helpful. A contrast-enhanced MRCP is recommended if the finding has not been previously evaluated.  3. No nephrolithiasis or explanation for the hematuria. 

 OSH RUQ U/S ___  Impression:  1. Dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts and common bile duct. Again an MRCP with contrast is recommended.  2. Cholelithiasis and equivocal gallbladder wall thickening. A HIDA scan could be performed if there is clinical evidence of acute cholecystitis. If not, the possible gallbladder wall thicvkening can be evaluated at the time of the MRCP.  OSH CXR ___ (AP Portable)  Impression:  1. Cardiomegaly    Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old man with mild COPD otherwise healthy presents with darkening urine and jaundice concerning for obstructive jaundice with T.bili ~10s.

#Jaundice, CBD dilation Patient's symptoms and bilirubin consistent with obstructive jaundice. CT abd/pelvis and RUQ ultrasound revealing biliary duct dilation and cholelithiasis. Patient underwent ERCP, which revealed a filling defect (stone vs tumor) in the middle third of the biliary tree. Brush cytology samples were collected of the main duct and common bile duct was stented, which resolved patient's symptoms correlating with downtrending t. bilirubin. Patient given IF fluids and was NPO, then advanced to BRAT diet to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis. MRCP was done afterwards, revealing no malignant biliary or pancreatic mass, but a 1.4cm gallstone in the neck of the bladder and subcentimeter intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with recommended repeat MRCP imaging in a year. Suspect that patient may have had intermittent choledocholithiasis and we recommend that patient have elective cholecystectomy. Patient was stable for discharge, tolerating PO well. 

#COPD: 20 pack year smoking history. COPD was stable. Foradil not on formulary, so patient was given salmeterol BID, duo-nebs PRN for SOB

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ====================== [] ___ CBD brushings from ERCP, pathology pending at discharge [] ___ appointment ERCP in 4 weeks [] elective outpatient cholecystectomy recommended for cholelithiasis [] repeat LFTs at PCP ___, downtrending after stent placement

 # CODE: Full, confirmed  # CONTACT: ___ (wife) ___  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol fumarate) 12 mcg inhalation BID 

  Discharge Medications: 1. Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol fumarate) 12 mcg inhalation BID 

  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Obstructive Jaundice

SECONDARY: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease intraductal papilloma mucinous neoplasm

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted because you were complaining of darkening urine and found to be jaundiced because there was an obstruction in your bile duct. You underwent a procedure called ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) where they took brushing samples of your biliary duct and placed a stent in your common bile duct which resolved your jaundice. You also got an MRI of your pancreatic and biliary system which revealed a gallstone as well as a cyst of the pancreatic duct called intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). We suspect that gallstones caused an obstruction leading to your symptoms, but might have passed before you got the ERCP. In 2 weeks, you can call the GI doctors to follow up the results of your brughings. In 4 weeks, you should have a repeat ERCP to re-evaluate your biliary system and to take out the stent. Afterwards, we recommend that you get your gallbladder removed by surgery. You should also have a repeat MRCP in a year to follow up the IPMN.

We wish you the best, Your ___ team  Followup Instructions: ___
