ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REPORT ___: COMMENTS:   1. Selective coronary angiography of the LMCA demonstrated 70% distal LMCA stenosis, 100% proximally occluded LAD, 70% ostial LCX stenosis with 80% stenosis in the AV groove branch. 2. Limited hemodynamics were performed. The systemic arterial pressures were normal measured 110/56mmHg. 3. Successful stenting of the LMCA with a 3.0x15mm Xience stent that was postdilated to 3.25mm. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments). 4. Course later complicated by hematoma and pseudoaneurysm treated with thrombin injection. 5. Patient participated in Champion PCI study involving randomization to Plavix or Cangrelor.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Normal systemic arterial pressures. 3. Successful stenting of the LMCA into the LCX.

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. The tracing is marred by baseline artifact. There is Q-T interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ left bundle-branch block is no longer recorded and the rate is slower. A repeat tracing of diagnostic quality is suggested.

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block is new as compared with prior tracing of ___ and similar to that recorded on ___. The presence of left bundle-branch block may be rate-related.

Right Femoral Vascular US ___: RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color and pulse wave Doppler examination was performed in the right groin region. Examination reveals a 3.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm pseudoaneurysm in the right groin, with visualization of the neck connecting the pseudoaneurysm to the right common femoral artery. The neck demonstrates to and fro flow, and is located slightly superomedially along the pseudoaneurysm. Normal flow is demonstrated in the common femoral artery. Wall-to-wall flow and normal compressibility is demonstrated in the right common femoral vein. Flow is also demonstrated in the greater saphenous vein. IMPRESSION: Pseudoaneurysm arising from right common femoral artery as described above.   Brief Hospital Course: This is an ___ year old male with history of multiple myocardial infarctions, coronary artery bypass graft with four vein grafts in ___, and chronic angina who was found to have NSTEMI at an outside hospital, underwent cardiac cath there demonstrating three vessel coronary artery disease and left main stenosis. No interventions were performed at the outside hospital and he was transferred to ___ for left main coronary artery stenting. 

1) Coronary Artery Disease: Cardicac catheterization demonstrated three vessel disease and 70% stenosis of the left main coronary artery which was successfully stented with a drug eluting stent. Patient remained chest pain free throughout this hospitalization. He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril and will continue taking plavix, simvastatin, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. He will follow up with his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. ___.  2) Femoral Hematoma: Following catheterization patient developed an expanding hematoma at access site. During this episode of bleeding patient became bradycardic and unresponsive. He regained responsiveness after intravenous fluid and one dose of atropine. Hematoma was stablized and patient was transferred to the CCU. Patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred back to the cardiology floor service. On hospital day 4 patient determined to have right femoral pseudoaneurysm diagnosed by a femoral bruit and confirmed by ultrasound. He was seen by the vascular surgery team who performed a thrombin ejection on ___. At time of discharge he was ambulating without any groin discomfort. He will follow up with Dr. ___ vascular surgery as an outpatient. 

 3) Pump: Patient remained euvolemic. An ECHO at the outside hospital on ___ showed normal left ventricular systolic function with EF 40-45%.   4) Rhythm: Patient remained in sinus rhythm with likely rate related left bundle branch block. 

5) Hypercholesterolemia: Patient was continued on his outpatient dose of simvastatin.

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Status Post Percutaneous Intervention and stent to the left main coronary artery, Right groin hematoma, Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm status post thrombin injection Secondary:Dyslipidemia, status post coronary artery bypass graft in ___, status post hernia repair

 Discharge Condition: good, chest pain free

 Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital in order to have a cardiac catheterization. You had the cardiac catheterization performed and had a stent placed in one of your heart vessels. Following the procedure you had groin bleeding and went to an intensive care unit until the bleeding had stabilized. You were then transferred back to the regular cardiology floor. We then determined that you had an outpouching of your right groin blood vessel called a pseudoaneurysm. The vascular surgeons performed a procedure to remedy this defect in your vessel. 

You will need to follow up as listed below.

You were started on the following NEW medications: -Lisinopril 5 mg daily -Metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL): This will replace your metoprolol tartrate. 

You should take the rest of your medications as directed.

If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or pass out please contact your primary care provider or come to the emergency department for evaluation.

 Followup Instructions: ___
