 History of Present Illness: ___ is a ___ yo right handed man with a history of atrial fibrillation who presents for evaluation of stroke. The patient reports the he was feeling well upon waking last ___ (___) and was planning on playing golf during the afternoon. At approximately 2:45, he stopped by his friend's and in while speaking to him he suddenly felt strange. His friend continued to speak and then asked him if he was feeling ok- the patient was unable to respond, saying he could not speak a word. His friend told him to sit down and the patient's symptoms seemed to improve. He was able to get up and walk outside of the home when he again was unable to speak. It was at that point that his friend called EMS. He was initially brought to ___ where his ___ Stroke Scale was 4 (breakdown unavailable, but appears to have had right arm and leg weakness as well as impaired language which was worsening during the evaluation). He was evaluated by telemedicine. CT head was negative and tPA was given at 15:39 (Bolus 7.5mg, then additional 66.3 over 60minutes). The patient's symptoms showed almost immediate improvement and was trasferred to ___ for further eval.

Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

Imaging:

MRI/MRA ___: There is a focal, subcentimeter area in the subcortical white matter of the left temporal lobe with increased signal on diffusion-weighted and FLAIR sequences with decreased signal on ADC (10:13). This is compatible with a small area of ischemia. There is no evidence of large territorial ischemia or infarction. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. There are areas of increased FLAIR signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter that likely represent changes from chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy. The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches appear normal without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. IMPRESSION: Subcentimeter diffusion abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left temporal lobe compatible with a small area of ischemia.

Echo ___: The left atrium is elongated. (Transthoracic echocardiography not adequate to assess for atrial appendage thrombus). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50-55 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

No cardiac source of embolus identified other than atrial fibrillation.  

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old right handed man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents for evaluation following acute speech arrest. Initial evaluation at ___ was concerning for aphasia and right sided weakness. He was given tPA within 1 hour and had rapid resolution of sx. Transfered to ___ where he had a mild right pronator drift and a brisk patellar reflex, but otherwise his neurologic exam was normal. CT head was without evidence of prior infarct or small vessle disease. The patient reports recently discontinuing his aspirin for a knee surgery. It is possible that he was acutely hypercoaguable in the setting of this medication change and recent surgery, this may also be considered aspirin failure or due to his atrial fibrillatiojn. Symptoms completely resolved. MRI/MRA showed subcentimeter diffusion abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left temporal lobe compatible with a small area of ischemia and nil on MRA. Echo showed mildly depressed LC function EF ___ and mildly dilated ascending aorta, no source of embolus. Transferred to floor ___. Received physical therapy and was asymptomatic during his admission.  Cardiologist (Dr. ___ at ___) was emailed in order to determine preference of anticoagulation but unfortunately we were unable to reach him. The patient refused coumadin regardless so he was started on dabigatran.

Given his altered lipid profile Simvastatin dose was raised to 40 mg qd.

He will continue follow up with Dr. ___.  Medications on Admission: - Flecanide 75mg BID - ASA 81mg - Simvastatin 20mg daily - Atenolol 12.5mg daily

 Discharge Medications: 1. dabigatran etexilate 150 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day). Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2* 2. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left temporal subcortical infarct hyperlipidemia

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. Neuro: no deficits

 Discharge Instructions: Dear ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at the ___. You were initially admited at ___ because you had trouble to express what you wanted to say. There it was noticed you also had weakness on the right side of your body. A CT scan was negative for bleeding so you received tPa to disolve the cloat that was causing your stroke. This was successful since your symptoms resolved in less than 2 hours. From ___ you were transfered to ___ to continue follow up. At admission you still presented slight weakness on your right arm but this resolved as well as your other symptoms. Your MRI showed a small infarct (stroke) on the subcortical area of the left temporal lobe. It is possible that this stroke was due to your recent medication change and surgery or to your atrial fibrillation. You will continue follow up with Dr. ___ in ___. Your antiplatelet medication was modified to start Dabigatran 150mg by mouth twice a day. We attempted to confirm this choice with your cardiologist prior to your discharge but was unable to reach him in time. We will contact you if we hear differently from him. Your lipid profile is above desirable limits, so your Simvastatin was increased to 40 mg per day. If you present a similar event, weakness, sensation deficit or any other neurological deficit you should consult at the Emergency Department inmediately.  Followup Instructions: ___
