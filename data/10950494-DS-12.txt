Carotid Bruit    Right: None  Left:None

 Pertinent Results: ECHO ___ The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 Colonoscopy ___ Normal terminal ileum Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon No avms seen Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and ileum

EGD ___ Angioectasia in the second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Capsule study ___ Nonbleeding angioectasia

CT scan ___ 1. Multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, but also involve the RLL, concerning for multifocal PNA. DDx also includes NSIP. 2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, without evidence of loculation. 3. Sub-5mm solid nodules in the RML and RLL. Punctate calcified granuloma in the right base. Calcified perihepatic nodule. 4. Significant 3-vessel coronary artery disease. 5. Small amount of scattered calcified atherosclerotic plaques in the ascending aorta, with a 2.8-cm relatively calcification-free segment starting approximately 1.2 cm superior to the origin of the right coronary artery. 

Carotid ultrasound ___ Results pending

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for further management of his cardiac disease and gastrointestinal bleed. He was placed in the intensive care unit and a gastroenterology consult was obtained. Anticoagulation was held and he was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of 30. A proton pump inhibitor was started. A cardiology consult was obtained who recommended a low dose beta blocker and a high dose statin given his presentation of demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. His troponin peaked at 1.39. An EGD was performed which showed angioectasia that were not bleeding in the duodenum with an otherwise normal study. A colonoscopy was also performed which showed diverticulum and internal hemorrhoid but was otherwise normal. He was transferred to the step down unit on ___ for further management and surgical planning. As there was no further evidence of GI bleeding, aspirin was restarted. A capsule study/virtual colonoscopy was started on ___ which showed non bleeding angioectasia. He remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. Coumadin remained on hold and will be addressed after he has had his surgery. Surgery was scheduled for ___. As he remained stable, he was discharged home on ___. He will have biweekly hematocrits sent to both our office and Dr. ___ drawn by the visiting nurse.. Surgical consent was obtained with the understanding that there was a higher risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding with heparinization with his surgery.
