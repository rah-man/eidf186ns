 History of Present Illness: ___ y/o M PMH cirrhosis ___ etoh, ___ on dialysis (___) who this morning was bringing his father to ___ when this morning he was in the waiting room and felt exhausted and then had a witnessed syncopal episode. He had no other pro-dromal symptoms at that time. He did not hit his head at that time, but did sustain an abrasion to his right hand and right knee. They wanted him to stay or go to ___, but the patient refused and signed out AMA. He reports that when he left the hospital, he walked out and felt the same exhaustion. He subsquently had another syncopal episode hit his head on the pavement and sustained a hematoma. Prior to this episode, he reports he denies any lightheadeness, changes in his vision, chest pain, paliptations, shortness of ___ symptoms, bowel or bladder incontinence. His nurse reports that he is incontinent of urine.  In the ED the patients initial vitals were 97.7 67 142/71 16 97%.

___ CXR FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette appears slightly decreased compared to the prior study and is within normal limits in size. Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion. No new focal areas of consolidation, or evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Assessment of retrosternal area on lateral view is limited by suboptimal positioning of the patient's arms related to the patient's inability to lift the arm in the setting of recent fracture. Vascular catheter is unchanged in position.  IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

LUNG SCAN ___ RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:  6.6 mCi Tc-99m MAA ___  43.4 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ___ HISTORY: ___ man with syncope and right heart hypokinesis. Evaluation for pulmonary embolism.  INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 6 views demonstrate mild heterogeneity without definite defect.  Perfusion images in the same 6 views show matched heterogeneity without definite defect.  Chest x-ray, 2-day old, shows no infiltrates.  IMPRESSION: Mild, matched heterogeneity of ventilation and perfusion, very low likelihood ratio of recent pulmonary embolism.

CXR ___ FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette appears slightly decreased compared to the prior study and is within normal limits in size. Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion. No new focal areas of consolidation, or evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Assessment of retrosternal area on lateral view is limited by suboptimal positioning of the patient's arms related to the patient's inability to lift the arm in the setting of recent fracture. Vascular catheter is unchanged in position.  IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process

ECHO ___ The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is no soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign body.  IMPRESSION: Fracture of the radial head with anterior joint effusion.  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ telephone on ___ at 4:15 ___, time of discovery.

___ LIVER/GALL BLADDER ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER FINDINGS:  The hepatic architecture is coarsened and nodular in appearance consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis. No focal liver lesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.2 cm.  The gallbladder is normal with no gallstones. The pancreas and midline structures including the aorta are obscured from view by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is normal measuring 12.1 cm. No ascites is seen in the abdomen.  DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and spectral waveform analysis was performed. The main, right and left portal veins are patent with hepatopetal flow. The hepatic veins and IVC are patent. Appropriate arterial waveforms are seen in the in the main, right and left hepatic arteries.  IMPRESSION:  1. No concerning liver lesion identified. Nodular hepatic architecture consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis.  2. Patent hepatic vasculature.  3. No ascites seen in the abdomen.

___ FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest. Dual lumen right-sided central venous catheter seen with distal tip in the right atrium.

No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved since prior. No evidence of consolidation

 CT C-SPINE: ___  There is no acute fracture or malalignment. There is mild degenerative change. A left uncovertebral osteophyte at C5-C6 mildly narrow the spinal canal. Otherwise, the visualized outline of the thecal sac appears unremarkable, although CT cannot provide intrathecal detail compared to MRI. There is apparent fusion of the C3 and C4 vertebrae, involving anterior and posterior elements, likely congenital. Prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained. There is no paravertebral hematoma.  No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland. The visualized lung apices are clear noting mild paraseptal emphysema.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the carotid bulbs.  IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or malalignment.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ FINDINGS:  CT HEAD: There is a small right frontal subgaleal hematoma.  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial infarct.

Small right frontal subgaleal hematoma. 

 Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:

___ y/o M PMH cirrhosis ___ etoh, ___ on dialysis (MWF) now admitted for syncope x 2.  #Syncope: Pt was profoundly orthostatic on exam after small 500mL bolus in ED. Pt reports low intake of fluids and food, though not due to nausea or pain. ECG unchanged from prior. Borderline QTc prolongation. No report of chest pain or discomfort. Pt has history of mild aortic stenosis based on Echo from ___ and did have AS murmur on exam on exam. Repeat ECHO this hospitalization showed global right hypokinesis, raising concern for a pulmonary embolism. He was not a candidate per the renal service for CTA as he still made urine and contrast would be destroy any remaining kidney function, even if dialyzed immediately after CTA. Thus a VQ scan was performed and found to be low risk for pulmonary embolism. Cardiology was consulted and recommended ___, HIV, CCP to evaluate for infectious and vasculitic etiologies of his right heart changes, and outpatient PFTs. HIV test was negative. They recommended cardiology follow up as an outpatient, with consideration at that time for whether a right heart catheterization would need to be performed in the future if these preliminary non invasive tests were unrevealing. They also recommended ___ of hearts monitor, which he will set up through cardiac services on follow up with Dr ___. Ultimately his orthostasis was thought to be due to a combination of orthostasis with relative hypovolemia, with patient being preload dependent in the setting of his pulmonary hypertension and mild AS. He was counseled not to drive or operate heavy machinery given that he had these syncopal events, and was educated about presyncopal signs to look out for including light headedness, dizziness, weakness, blurry vision. He was discharged with instructions to take his midodrine daily as opposed to just on dialysis days, to help with his orthostatic hypotension on off dialysis days as well. He was cleared by physical therapy for home. ___ was positive with titre pending at the time of discharge, as were CCP and Blood cultures from ___ and should be followed up by his PCP. Additionally, he should be set up for outpatient PFTs by his PCP. -CCP returned negative - ___ with titer 1:320

. Left radial head fracture: pt with intense L elbow pain after fall. Xray revealed left radial head fracture. Seen by orthopedics, recommended sling, which he has,non weight bearing to left upper extremity, gentle ROM exercises for elbow 3x/day out of sling to avoid stiffness, and follow up with Dr ___ in ___ days for repeat x-rays. As patient was discharged on a holiday, he is provided the number to call to schedule an appointment with Dr ___. . # ___ V on dialysis (MWF): Cr at recent baseline. Pt had normal renal function until hospitalization in ___. ___ was attributed to ATN from hypotension per ___ discharge summary. Dialysis through tunneled line was performed during his hospitalization with last dialysis ___. He had vein mapping performed of the upper extremities, which had not been read at the time of discharge. The renal team planned to contact outpatient transplant surgery so that they were aware of patient's need for evaluation for a fistula. He will need an appointment with transplant surgery once the results of the vein mapping are final and his PCP should facilitate setting up this appointment with transplant surgery (___). . # alcoholic cirrhosis: during his initial presentation in ___, Pt had alcoholic cirrhosis and liver failure w/ rectal bleed, grade 1 varices, and 2 x SBP. Pt was placed on nadolol and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis but has since been w/out much abdominal distention or peripheral edema and has not had any SBP or bleed. No ascites on abdominal US and no concern for SBP. Continued home nadolol, omeprazole and ciprofloxacin was refilled (he had run out of this medication.

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you passed out twice. Tests and images were performed to determine the reason you passed out. The right side of your heart is not working as well as it used to, and you will need to see a cardiologist to determine if you will need further evaluation of this, called a right heart catheterization. In the meantime we recommend that you take your midodrine daily, as your orthostatic hypotension may have contributed to your passing out. Please do not drive, or pull over to the side of the road if you are driving, if you feel light headed, have blurry vision or chest pain.

 Followup Instructions: ___
