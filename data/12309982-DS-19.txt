ECG ___ Sinus rhythm. Mild Q-T interval prolongation. Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads V1-V3 with T wave inversions in leads V1-V4. Consider myocardial infarction and/or ischemia. Since the previous tracing of ___ changes in R wave progression and precordial T wave inversions with Q-T interval prolongation are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR ___ PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate clear, well-expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. No signs of CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.

Cardiac Catheterization ___ 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel obstructive coronary artery disease.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.  Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were here at ___. You were admitted to the hospital after your PCP/Cardiologist found EKG changes that were concerning for coronary artery disease and felt that this may be related to the chest pain you had been experiencing. While you were here your cardiac enzymes increased which indicates that you had a small heart attack, which may have been triggered by the shoveling you were doing over the weekend. You were treated with medications and underwent a cardiac catheterization where we found a very tight area in one of the major arteries supply the blood to your heart muscle. A stent was placed in this and you were started on multiple medications to try to help your heart heal, prevent future heart attacks and to keep your stent open. It is critical that you take your clopidogrel (plavix) every single day to prevent the stent from closing.
