Celiac and splenic artery angiogram with interventional radiology 2. Placement of 8mm amplatzer device in the proximal splenic artery with interventional radiology 

 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a metastatic melanoma with lesions to the brain s/p resection and radiation, left femur, and spleen s/p ___ feducial placement on ___ who presents after a syncopal episode on ___. He had been in his usual state of health after the procedure with some abdominal soreness but no significant pain or lightheadedness/dizziness. He was at the store on ___ when he experienced severe, sudden onset bandlike pain across his upper abdomen. This continued for a few minutes, so he went to check out and lost consciousness with headstrike. He awoke on the ground. No one described any shaking or seizure like activity and he denies tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder control. He was brought to ___ ___ where he was hemodynamically stable with negative head CT. CT of the abdomen notable for splenic hematoma and he was transferred to ___ for definitive care. 

In the ED, initial vitals: T 97.5, HR 80, BP 130/92, RR 16, SaO2 98% RA.  - Exam notable for: AAOx3, benign exam - Labs notable for: ___ H+H ___ 05:47 H+H 9.0/26.9 ___ H+H 8.6/25.5 UA - SpecGrav 1.037, Prot trace, Gluc 300mg, Ket 40, Bacteria Few - Imaging notable for: CT abdomen showed internal progressive enhancement over arterial and venous phases, without definite evidence of active extravasation. - Pt given: Nothing

___ and ACS were consulted, and ___ management was preferred. ___ performed celiac and then splenic angiogram, and there was no evidence of active extravasation. Irregular areas in spleen were noted, possibly the known lesions concerning for mets. Given that the hematoma showed interval increase on CT today compared to OSH image yesterday, an 8mm amplatzer device was placed in the proximal splenic artery to decrease vascular pressure to the spleen.

IMAGING: ___ CT TORSO 1. Status post placement of two fiducial seeds adjacent to a hypodense splenic metastasis. 2. Interval development of a moderate-sized subcapsular splenic hematoma. 3. Moderate amount of new intermediate density intraperitoneal free fluid may represent resolving hemorrhagic fluid. 4. Subcapsular areas of hypodensity within the inferior aspect of the spleen (? Laceration) are most consistent with sequela of recent fiducial placement. 5. Heterogeneous bibasilar pulmonary opacities appear similar to ___ and may represent an infectious or inflammatory process, however malignancy is not excluded. 6. Known osseous metastasis in the subtrochanteric left femur is better assessed on prior PET-CT.

___ CTA ABDOMEN/PELVIS 1. Re- demonstration of known splenic metastasis with two adjacent fiducial seeds. This lesion demonstrates internal progressive enhancement over arterial and venous phases, without definite evidence of active extravasation. 2. Subcapsular areas of hypodensity within the inferior aspect of the spleen (? Laceration) are most consistent with sequela of recent fiducial placement. 3. Stable heterogeneous subcapsular splenic hematoma. No evidence of active extravasation into the subcapsular hematoma. 4. Moderate volume of intra-abdominal free fluid measures hemorrhagic density. 5. Assessment of the splenic parenchyma on the arterial phase is limited due to intrinsic heterogeneous splenic enhancement. Allowing for this limitation, there is no definite evidence of pseudoaneurysm. 6. Heterogeneous bibasilar pulmonary opacities again may represent an infectious or inflammatory process, however malignancy is not excluded. 7. Known osseous metastasis in the subtrochanteric left femur is better assessed on prior PET-CT.  ___ SPLENIC ARTERIOGRAM Successful splenic arterial angiogram without discrete evidence of active extravasation.  However, given the increasing size of the perisplenic hematoma on the concomitant CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, an Amplatzer plug was deployed to decrease pressures to the presumed location of hemorrhage.  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with metastatic melanoma s/p ___ splenic feducial placement on ___ who presented after a syncopal episode found to have splenic hematoma who underwent ___ amplatzer device placement.

#Splenic hematoma: He was hemodynamically stable with a stable H/H on initial presentation to the ED. CTA and celiac/splenic angiogram demonstrated no active extravasation. His CT on ___ showed an interval increase in hematoma size and intraperitoneal fluid compared to CT on ___. Given this, ___ placed an 8mm amplatzer device in the proximal splenic artery. His dressing over the catheterization site remained clean, dry and intact without tenderness or underlying hematoma. Serial HRs, blood pressures, and hematocrits were stable. He endorsed only mild abdominal cramping and denied any dizziness/lightheadedness at discharge. He does not need follow up with interventional radiology. 

#Syncope: Patient had a syncopal episode at the hardware store, likely vasovagal secondary to sudden onset of pain. There were no prodromal symptoms. This is somewhat concerning for an arrhythmia, though the patient has no cardiac history and denied any palpitations/chest pain. He may benefit from a Holter monitor as an outpatient. Orthostatic syncope is less likely given no orthostatic symptoms or recent n/v/d. No observed seizure activity, post-ictal symptoms, tongue biting, or bowel/bladder incontinence to raise concern for seizure in the setting of brain mets. CT head with no e/o of new hemorrhage from fall. 

#Hyponatremia: Sodium 128 on admission, with elevated urine osms (705) and urine sodium (84), consistent with SIADH likely in the setting of his known malignancy. His sodium was stable at 128 at discharge.

Transitional issues: -Recommend follow up with PCP to discuss recent syncopal episode and any changes in plans to proceed with radiation given splenic hematoma -Recommend outpatient Holter monitor to assess for any arrhythmias that may have caused his syncope -Patient counseled not to drive for 6 weeks following syncopal episode in accordance with ___ law -No ___ needed with interventional radiology -Hg on discharge: 8.8. Recommend repeating CBC at PCP ___ visit. -Patient with hyponatremia with Ulytes consistent with SIADH. He was discharged on a fluid resctrition. Please repeat Na at PCP ___ visit to ensure stability. Na 128 on discharge.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 850 mg PO DAILY 2. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO QHS 3. Pravastatin 20 mg PO QPM 4. amlodipine-benazepril ___ mg oral DAILY 5. Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine-benazepril ___ mg oral DAILY  2. MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 850 mg PO DAILY  3. Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY  4. Pravastatin 20 mg PO QPM  5. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO QHS 

 Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Splenic hematoma Secondary: Syncope, metastatic melanoma, Type 2 diabetes, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia 

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

We saw your in the hospital because you lost consciousness in the hardware store and were found to have some bleeding in your spleen. The bleeding in your spleen may have been caused by the radiation beads that were placed. We did several tests that showed there was no continued bleeding in the spleen. The interventional radiology team placed a plug-like device (called an amplatzer device) in the blood vessel that goes to your spleen to help reduce the blood pressure to the spleen. This will help prevent any new or additional bleeding. Your blood counts remained stable after the procedure and you felt well.

We think you lost consciousness due to the sudden severe pain that you felt. You had a CAT scan of your head at ___ which showed there was no bleeding in your brain after you hit your head. The state of ___ stipulates that people who have had a loss of consciousness should not drive for 6 months after their episode, because there is a risk that you might lose consciousness again while driving. We recommend that you abide by this. 

You do not need to ___ with the interventional radiology team here. You should follow up with your primary care doctor to touch base about continuing plans for radiation.

Your sodium level was slightly low. Please limit the amount of fluid you take in to less than 1.5L per day. Your primary care physician ___ recheck your sodium level in ___.

It was a pleasure to participate in your care. 

Sincerely, Your ___ team  Followup Instructions: ___
