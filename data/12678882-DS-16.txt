During the prior hospitilization the CHF wast treated with fluid removal via HD. The CHF is of unknown etiology and was believed to be due to balanced three-vessel CAD vs deterioration of hypertensive cardiomyopathy vs amyloid cardiomyopathy. Her daughter (who is a ___) reports that her conversation has changed and she is unstable on her feet since her previous discharge. Cough was fully resolved and her strength was approaching baseline upon discharge from ___ on ___, however, she soon developed a reccurent dry hacking cough with some frothy sputum production.

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, orhotpnea, cough, palpitations and mental status changes with elevated JVP on clinical exam, consistent with acute heart failure on admission. Additionally nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea may also be a manifestiation of heart failure. TTE (___) which showed systolic dysfunction with EF of 45-50% decreased to LVEF= 20% on ___ with illustration of biventricular failure. Stress test on ___ showed no ischemic or reversible changes. Prior MIBI showed diffuse hypokinesis. This is potentially due to balanced three-vessel CAD vs deterioration of hypertensive cardiomyopathy vs amyloid cardiomyopathy. SPEP was unremarkable. Patient was placed on telemetry without acute events (prolonged PR consistent with first degree heart block was noted) EKG was unremarkable, troponins were 0.04/0.03 and stable in setting of CKD, and there was no increase in daily weight. She underwent hemodialysis with removal of 1.5L of fluid with significant symptomatic improvement in her symptoms. Continued on low sodium diet. Scheduled to follow up with cardiology, heart failure service. 

# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: daughter reports altered mental status that has not resolved since discharge from hospital in ___. Etiology considerations include infection, cardiopulmonary causes, medication effect or withdrawal. This improved with dialysis but unlikely due to uremia given mild elevation in BUN.

# Elevated lactate: etiologies include decreased perfusion from infection or decompensated heart failure vs. decreased lactate clearance vs. medication effect. No recorded hypotension. No prescribed biguanides. Patient does have abdominal pain. LFTs are mildly elevated. Previous toxicology screens and work up negative. Patient placed on thiamine last admission with thought of thiamnine dificiency as a contributing factor. Lactate normalized on second day prior to dialysis. Blood cultures still pending. 

# Left ventricular thrombus: Patient recently initiated on warfarin for LV thrombus found to have an elevated INR of 4.3 in the setting of acute decompensation. Warfarin was held and INR was trended, 3.9 on date of discharge. Will require close follow-up.

# Cough: etiologies include pulmonary edema vs. infection. No on ACE-I. Pertussis serology negative from previous admission. Given marked improvement with dialysis, appears to be due to fluid overload.   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: could be ___ to acute congestive heart failure vs. infectious etiology. Patient reports 3 bowel movements per day with mucus. Resolved with dialysis.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___:

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitilization at ___. You had come in because you were having increased nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, shortness of breath and cough. Additionally your daughter noted that your mental status had changed. We did some tests and found that you had an acute worsening of your heart failure. We are unsure of the cause at this point, but we are running some studies to help us figure this out. With regards to you lactic acidosis this improved on its own. There is no evidence that you have an infection at this juncture. We also noted that your INR was elevated and we stopped the warfarin. Your symptoms improved after hemodialysis. We ask that you weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

For your hemorrhoids, we have written a prescription for Tucks ointment.

We made the following changes to your medication list: Please START taking Tucks ointment for your hemorrhoids. Please STOP taking warfarin. You will be instructed when you will restart this medication. Please continue taking the rest of your home medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with your appointments as outlined below.

Thank you.  Followup Instructions: ___
