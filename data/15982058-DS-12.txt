IMAGING: ========================= CT ABD/PELVIS (___) 1. Duodenal wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding likely reflects duodenitis. Fluid filled jejunum, some loops of which appear mildly thickened and may reflect enteritis. 2. Partially visualized distal esophagus wall thickening may reflect esophagitis, but neoplasm is not excluded. Recommend follow-up with gastroenterology and possible endoscopy or upper GI series. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of HTN, HLD who presents with persistent nausea and vomiting.

# VIRAL GASTROENTERITIS: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting, with improved diarrhea. CT abd/pelvis showed duodenitis and esophagitis. This is non-specific and may represent viral gastroenteritis and irritation from vomiting. Lipase and LFTs were normal. The patient received IVF, anti-emetics, protonix, magic mouthwash, and sucralfate. The patient will take her own PPI after discharge. 

# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: This presented as hematuria and dysuria. Urine culture is growing E. coli. Sensitivities are pending. The patient does not have a significant history of urinary tract infections, therefore antibiotic resistance is not suspected. She was treated with ceftriaxone x 2 days and will be discharged with one day of bactrim. Her symptoms resolved prior to discharge.

# HYPERTENSION: Blood pressures were elevated (SBP 160-180s) during admission. This is likely due to a sympathetic response from her illness. She was continued on enalapril.

# GLAUCOMA: The patient was continued on home travaprost eye drops.
