===== MICRO =====

Urine culture (___): No growth (final) Blood culture (___): No growth as of ___

===== IMAGING =====

ECG (___): Sinus arrhythmia or atrial premature beats. Consider left atrial abnormality. Left anterior fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the rate is now faster. ST-T wave abnormality pattern is somewhat different, may be related to rate differences. Clinical correlation is suggested. 

CXR (___): AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. Despite low lung volumes, the lungs appear clear. No large effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with mild cardiomegaly in an unfolded thoracic aorta. Bony structures are intact. 

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER (___): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___): FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, mass effect, or acute large vascular territorial infarct.  Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with atrophy. Periventricular and subcortical gray matter hypodensities are likely sequelae of chronic small vessel disease. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells bilaterally. There is minimal mucosal thickening of the bilateral sphenoid sinuses. Maxillary sinuses were not imaged.  There is minimal mucosal thickening of the bilateral frontal sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear. No acute fracture is seen.  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Increased aortic gradients due to relatively vigorous LV systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation and minimal aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary hypertension. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with h/o dementia, HFpEF and CLL who presented with several days of worsening AMS, hypoxemia and cough, subsequently diagnosed with HFpEF exacerbation.

# HFpEF Exacerbation: Patient presented to the ED with history of cough and had a new ___ oxygen requirement. Creatinine was 1.7 on admission. BNP was elevated to 1631 without any prior value in our system for comparison. He carries a diagnosis of HFpEF and is on torsemide as an outpatient. CXR was without frank pulmonary edema or consoidation, although there was mild-moderate engorgement of the pulmonary ateries suggestive of mild volume overload. This was consistent with his new lower extremity 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. He had no fever or sputum production suggestive of pneumonia. He was treated empirically for HFpEF exacerbation with IV lasix with rapid improvement in his cough and O2 requirement (weaned to room air by ___. His creatinine downtrended with diuresis to 1.2 on day of discharge. A TTE was performed on ___ which revealed no significant changes from his prior echo (preserved EF >55%). On day of discharge he was transitioned to an increased dose of torsemide 60mg PO qday. Physical therapy recommended discharge to rehab facility before he returns home.

# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: On admission, the patient was somewhat somnolent (significantly more so than baseline per PCP notes and discussion with his daughter). TSH and B12 levels were within normal limits. The primary cause of his altered mental status is thought to have been delirium secondary to decompensated heart failure, superimposed on the patient's baseline dementia. His mental status improved significantly with treatment of his heart failure decompensation. Irrespective of the patient's substantial improvement, we believe he would benefit from a higher level of care at home on an ongoing basis. These concerns were discussed with the patient, his daughter, and his PCP at his assisted living facility who will make the necessary adjustments to his care plan.

# T2DM: The patient pre-admission medication list included glyburide. This medication is particulary dangerous in elderly populations and with this patient has both impaired kidney function and heart failure, both of which significantly impair his ability to clear glyburide and glyburide metabolites from his body. The biologic half-life of glyburide is thus prolonged. Furthermore, given the patient's advanced age and co-existing comorbidities, it seems that lenient glycemic control would likely the best course of care. The patient's glyburide was therefore discontinued. Since his A1c this admission was 8.7% and his sulfonylurea was discontinued, his home metformin XL 1000mg qday was increased to short-acting metformin 850mg BID. We recommend against initiating any oral hypoglycemic agent as the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the benefit of tight glycemic control in this patient. If an additional agent is absolutely required, we would recommend considering a small once daily dose of Lantus in addition to his metformin.

# Anemia: Hgb ~10 while inpatient. Unclear baseline. Iron studies consistent with iron deficiency anemia with superimposed anemia of chronic disease. Ongoing iron supplementation is appropriate as long as this is tolerated well by the patient and does not precipitate constipation. He was discharged on his home iron regimen.

===== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =====

# HFpEF: - Continue torsemide at new dose of 60mg PO qday. - Please weight patient daily. If patient gains more than 3 lbs from his discharge weight of 203.6 lbs, please increase dose of torsemide to 80mg PO qday or contact his primary care provider for further instructions. - Please check Chem-10 on ___ and send result to his PCP (see prescription for details).

# T2DM: - Glyburide was discontinued this admission due to concern regarding its contribution to patient's altered mental status as well as questionable safety of this medication in the setting of impaired renal function (renally-cleared). - Metformin XL was discontinued and replaced with short-acting metformin 850mg BID. - Recommend against starting an oral hypoglycemic agent due to risk of hypoglycemia and limited benefit of tight glycemic control in this patient.
