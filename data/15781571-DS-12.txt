Upon arrival to the floor, Ms. ___ confirmed the above story with her son ___ (son ___ also at bedside).  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete 10-point review of systems was performed and was negative except for as noted in the HPI. She does also describe chronic increased urinary frequency and intermittent incontinence that are long-standing.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY, per primary oncologist note: Pt reported increasing bloating and abdominal pain beginning in early ___ that worsened for a month. She was seen at her PCP's office on ___ at which point TSH, albumin, LFTs were drawn and were all within normal limits. She underwent an abdominal ultrasound on ___ which showed large volume ascites with peritoneal nodularity visualized within the pelvis with concern for ovarian malignancy or other primary. She had a follow up CT abdomen/pelvis on ___ which showed massive ascites. Neither ovary were clearly visualized nor was the appendix. Peritoneal nodularity seen on US was not clearly identified though there was some mild hyperenhancement of the inferior peritoneal surface just superior to the bladder. 

She subsequently had a therapeutic paracentesis on ___ with evacuation of 3L of fluid. Cytology report showed high grade serous carcinoma with p53 showing mutant pattern staining. 

She was seen by OB/GYN on at which point she noted the fluid appeared to be recurring. ___ weight gain in the last 6mo. She has a history of leg swelling for which she takes lasix 30mg QD. She was recommended tumor markers including CA125, CEA, and ___ CT-Chest; diagnostic laparoscopy to assess disease extent which will likely be followed by chemotherapy with a possible interval cytoreductive surgery including a total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy, omentectomy, and removal of residual disease. Hearing this plan, pt expressed interest in forgoing surgery. 

At first oncology visit on ___, she explained her greatest source of discomfort was abdominal pain/bloating. We recommended CT chest to complete staging and a visit with OB/GYN to discuss the role for surgical management of her disease.

 Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: ___ year old woman with metastatic serous carcinoma and malignant ascites s/p 6 cycles of second line therapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin (___) who presented with nausea/vomiting and constipation, found to have a malignant partial bowel obstruction, with course complicated by high symptom burden and malnutrition. 

On ___, the patient and her family requested that she be discharged with the plan to go to the ___ emergency department in order to seek a second opinion. While we support patient autonomy, this decision occurred against medical advice. The family understands the risks associated with leaving the hospital at this time though this continues to be their preference. We have prepared as much of the discharge paperwork as able in an effort to best facilitate the remainder of her care. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Code status: Full Contact: ___ - ___ Discharge weight: 42.8 kg

# High grade metastatic serous adenocarcinoma, likely from the ovary: - CA 125 (___): 76 - Requesting a second opinion from ___ oncology - Ongoing discussions re: code status and goals of care (recommending discharge to hospice)

# Bowel obstruction: - Pt and family requested NGT removal ___ - We recommend placing a venting G-tube in addition to percutaneous peritoneal pleurX catheter with palliative intent, though this was not performed given family's wishes to seek a second opinion - If able to tolerate by mouth, will continue the following: -- Lansoprazole 30 mg SL once daily -- Dexamethasone 4 mg PO once daily - *consider down titration -- Oxycontin 10 mg q12h standing + hydromorphone 2 mg PO q4h:PRN -- Zofran ODT 8 mg SL q8h PRN nausea -- Compazine 10 mg PO q8h PRN nausea -- Lorazepam ___ mg PO PRN nausea -- Bisacodyl suppositories BID, though unlikely to take at home

# Malignant ascites: - ___ require repeat therapeutic paracentesis (though would prefer percutaneous peritoneal pleurX placement)

# IgA/IgG pemphigus foliaceus: - Continue Mycophenolate Mofetil as long as she can tolerate PO - Holding triamcinolone and betamethasone cream for now

# Holding to following medications (mainly to minimize pill burden), though can restart as indicated: - Prednisone 5 mg PO once daily (in exchange for dexamethasone 4 mg) - Metoprolol succinate XL 50 mg once daily - Simvastatin 20 mg PO QPM - Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg PO daily - Multivitamin PO once daily - Calcium 600 - D3 400 unit PO BID - Docusate sodium 100 mg PO BID (held iso bowel obstruction) - Polyethylene Glycol 17 mg PO daily (held iso bowel obstruction)

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Malignant bowel obstruction: CT scan on admission was suggestive of enteritis, though on further review she likely had a bowel obstruction. Multiple KUBs show stability if not worsening of her obstructive process. Treated with aggressive bowel regimen (enemas, suppositories) along with octreotide, dexamethasone and anti-emetics; trialed metoclopramide with minimal effect. NGT placed ___ with symptomatic relief, though removed ___ per family and patient request. Will attempt to change medications from IV to PO, though octreotide will have to be discontinued. Attempted to place a venting G-tube and percutaneous peritoneal pleurx with ___ though given family's request for a second opinion, this was not performed as it is strictly for palliative intent. 

# Metastatic high grade serous adenocarcinoma, likely ovarian: # Malignant ascites: Presented in ___ with ascites, cytology positive for high grade adenocarcinoma. Imaging has been unhelpful in terms of identifying the origin of her disease, though per outpatient oncology it is likely from the ovary and she has peritoneal disease as well. She is s/p 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin (ended ___, though this was stopped given concern for carboplatin resistance and poor functional status. As above, she presented with nausea and vomiting, found to have a bowel obstruction which has not improved despite aggressive management. She also had a therapeutic paracentesis on ___ for which 1.7L was drained. Unfortunately, due to her severe malnutrition, disease progression and poor functional status, we recommended against further chemotherapy and there are no surgical options from our perspective at this time. Our goal would be to send her to home hospice vs a ___ facility, though family is requesting a second opinion at ___. Both the family and patient have been informed that her prognosis is poor and that she likely has weeks to live. 

# Malnutrition: Pt presented malnourished and remains severely malnourished given inability to take PO in the setting of a persistent bowel obstruction. We opted against initiating TPN as the fluid would likely cause more harm and accumulate in her abdomen. That said, she was continued on ___ NS at 75cc/hr for the majority of her hospital stay. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: # IgA/IgG pemphigus foliaceus: Held home prednisone 5 mg in exchange for Dexamethasone 4 mg as above. Continued Mycophenolate Mofetil as an IV form, will transition to PO at discharge. 

# Macrocytic anemia: Hb 10.3 and MCV 104 at time of discharge. Has a history of vitamin B12 deficiency though this has been appropriately treated (B12 now > 1,000 on recheck). Peripheral smear showed macroovalocytes. This may be secondary to folate deficiency but is more likely to toxicity from chemotherapy and malnutrition.

# Hypertension: SBPs hovered around 130-170s. Did not treat during hospitalization. 

# Hyperglycemia: AM glucose between 100s-140s, did not require insulin.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you were having abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.

What happened in the hospital? - You were found to have a bowel obstruction.
