 History of Present Illness: The patient is a ___ year old right handed man with history of lung mass which is being worked up for possible malignancy, otherwise no significant known past medical history, who presents with a 3 minute episode of left arm sensory changes with generalization. History provided by patient.

Mr. ___ reports he was in his usual state of health until about 7:40pm on the day of presentation (___) , about 1 hour prior to ED evaluation. He was sitting on his couch watching Jeopardy and just lit a cigarette. Moments later, he developed an abnormal sensation in his index and middle fingers of his left hand. This is described as a "tense feeling,", "a numbness," and a "feeling of weakness." Within seconds it affected the entire left hand. It then migrated proximally up the left arm over about 1 minute. After this he felt the feeling throughout his entire body. He curled up in the fetal position because "it was the only thing I could do." He reports he felt "out of control" during the event. He maintained consciousness throughout the event. While this was happening he was able to pick up a phone with his right hand, but could not manipulate the phone to dial the numbers with his left hand. The episode resolved after 3 minutes, after which point he was able to dial 911. Immediately after the event and while en route to ED, he had left arm circumferential numbness that gradually improved and resolved by the time of presentation to ED. He currently feels at baseline. Throughout this period, he denied shaking movements, tongue biting, bowel/bladder incontinence and headache. Denied visual changes. He has never had this happen before. He denies any recent changes to lifestyle including lack of sleep, medication changes, recent illness, or fevers/chills.

Of note, patient is in the process of being worked up for unknown lung masses/lesions. He had a chronic, progressive cough productive of white sputum, associated with some right chest discomfort. He underwent CXR for ___ months ago which revealed abnormal opacities, prompting chest CT. This showed dominant right lower lobe lung mass, bilateral lung nodules and other smaller lesions with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. He was referred to Pulmonary Clinic (Dr. ___ for these findings, seen on ___. He then underwent transbnronchial biopsy of mass with radial endobronchial guidance on ___. Results are pending at this time. He did have some growth on BAL (S. pneumo, N. meningitidis) for which he was prescribed Z-pack. Patient has not yet been seen formally by Oncology, but has a PET scan planned for tomorrow. 

Also of note: until recently, patient had not seen a doctor in many years. He tells me he saw his PCP to get CXR in end of ___ prior to that he had not seen a physician or received any medical attention whatsoever since over ___ years, since ___. 

He is an active smoker but is currently cutting down on his cigarette use.

MRI BRAIN WITH ___: 1. Multiple supratentorial and infratentorial enhancing lesions consistent with metastases. 2. The largest 1.9 cm lesion in the right frontal lobe contacts the dura with adjacent dural enhancement. Dural invasion cannot be excluded. This lesion also demonstrates mild blood products and moderate surrounding vasogenic edema. 3. No ventricular effacement or shift of midline structures. 

PET ___: 1. 6.7 cm FDG avid right lower lobe primary lung neoplasm with metastatic lymphadenopathy to the right hilum, right mediastinum, and left peribronchial stations, as well as a 2.3 cm left adrenal gland metastasis.    2. Two (2) closely adjacent FDG avid left upper lobe nodules measuring up to 2.0 cm, concerning for synchronous site of primary lung neoplasm versus contralateral lung metastasis.    3. Indeterminate focal FDG activity in the right anterior spinal canal versus adjacent T5-6 vertebral bodies, without discernible underlying CT correlate. Recommend MRI thoracic spine for further evaluation. 

CT HEAD ___: 1.5 x 1.4 cm right frontal lobe hyperdense lesion with surrounding edema, highly suspicious for metastasis. Hemorrhage within the lesion cannot be ruled out. Please note that MR brain is more sensitive for evaluation of metastatic lesions. 

CXR ___: Dominant right lower lobe mass with hilar/mediastinal adenopathy. No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.  

 

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with history of lung mass s/p recent biopsy, found to be squamous cell carcinoma, otherwise no significant known past medical history, who presents with a 3 minute episode of left arm sensory changes with generalization. History notable for acute onset of left hand sensory changes with migration proximally up the left arm and then to the remainder of the body, lasting for 3 minutes, with alteration of consciousness suspicious for seizure. Given the focality at seizure onset, patient underwent CT head which showed right frontal hyperdense mass with associated edema concerning for metastatic disease. He was admitted for MRI and further work-up. MRI with contrast revealed multiple supratentorial and infratentorial enhancing lesions consistent with metastases. Neurosurgery did not recommend intervention. He will follow-up with neuro-oncology for further treatment recommendations. 

For the seizure, he was started on Keppra 1g BID and tolerated that well. He was advised that he should not drive for 6 months in the setting of seizures.
