 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization. You were admitted for bloody bowel movements. Your blood count was low and you received blood. The GI service was consulted and performed two endoscopies which did not identify an obvious source of bleeding. You blood counts stabilized and you did not have any further episodes of bleeding. You will need to follow up with GI as an outpatient.

We also held several of your blood pressure and heart failure medications this admission because of concern for bleeding. Fortunately, you did not have further bloody bowel movements and your blood counts were stable. However, we did not restart all your home medications because you admitted with dehydration. When you go home we will have you take only some of your medications. We want you to follow up in clinic with your primary care doctor and cardiologist so that they can make adjustments. 

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ Team
