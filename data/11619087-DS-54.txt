Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a ___ woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune cirrhosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, RLE amputation with multiple prior admissions for UTI, most recently discharged on ___, who presents with 2 days of vomiting and AMS.

Ms. ___ caregivers have noted that she has not returned to her normal state of health since her prior hospitalization. However, she worsened from her post-discharge baseline over the 5 days prior to admission. She has had poor PO intake and appetite for the past 5 days, and for the past 2 days has been more lethargic and less conversant with 4 episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She has 24 hour home health aide support and ___ services at home ___ manages her ___ noted no fevers at home, but decreased urine output, and BPs in 170s-200s.

On her last admission, she presented with AMS and was found to have a bilateral pyelonephritis and improved with treatment with meropenem, which was switched to Bactrim when sensitivities returned. She was discharged on PO Bactrim. On the prior admission (discharged ___, she had been admitted for hepatic encephalopathy and UTI. 

She has an permanent catheter that that was placed during her admission in ___. She was seen by uro-gyn in ___ who started prophylactic abx (Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO). Per prior notes, the catheter has remained in place per patient preference because she has very limited mobility. 

Pertinent ED course (including exam, labs, imaging, consults, treatment): Upon presentation to the ED: Vitals: 97.7, 73, 173/83, 99% RA Labs notable for NA 125, K 5.8, Cr 3.4; WBC: 12.3, H/H 9.6/___.4. Repeat whole blood K found to be 5.2 Glucose: 88 UA: + WBCs, + leuks

Neurology evaluated the patient in the ED and noted stable anisocoria from prior admissions and left facial droop, but concluded that her presentation is most consistent with delirium. Neurology will follow. 

The patient received 1g ceftriaxone, glucagon, 1L NS before being transferred to the floor.  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports back pain and fatigue, but denies other sources of discomfort. She notes that her back pain is consistent with her usual back pain at home. She is unable to say if she is better from prior. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, pain with urination.

IMAGING ======= ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND (___) IMPRESSION: Limited imaging of the abdomen demonstrate cirrhotic liver, small volume ascites, and small right pleural effusion.

ABDOMINAL X-RAY (___) IMPRESSION: Dilated colon which is filled with a significant amount of air and stool. No small-bowel obstruction.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___) IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ female with h/o cirrhosis d/t autoimmune hepatitis, DM1, CKD, and multiple admissions for recurrent UTI admitted for AMS thought to be secondary to long-acting narcotics potentiated by poor oral intake and subsequent ___.

#) Delirium, hypoactive: suspect AMS was primarily due to methadone overdose in the setting ___ and impaired narcotic clearance. Picture was likely multifactorial; that is, complicated by multiple electrolyte abnormalities, hepatic encephalopathy, and constipation. Patient was initially treated with empiric Zosyn for possible UTI, but this was ultimately discontinued, as sepsis investigations were unrevealing. Patient had a small amount of ascites, but her exam remained inconsistent with SBP. Head CT did not demonstrated acute intracranial pathology. She returned to baseline mental status by discharge.

#) ___ on CKD: Cr 3.4 upon admission (baseline 1.4-1.8). Injury was thought to be pre-renal in nature, given suboptimal oral intake. Urine output and creatinine improved with fluids, albeit slowly, suggesting concomitant ATN or intra-renal injury. Further investigation was deemed inconsistent with new goals of care.

#) Constipation, opioid-induced: KUB demonstrated significant amount of stool upon admission. Home lactulose was titrated to ___ bowel movements per day. Resolution seemingly paralleled return to baseline mentation.

#) DM1: patient had one asymptomatic episode of ___ ___ due to poor oral intake and insulin stacking in the setting of ___. Home insulin glargine and ISS were accordingly adjusted. Home basal regimen was cautiously reintroduced.

#) Hypercalcemia: improved with fluids and restoration of kidney function. Probably due to immobility. PTH appropriately low. CXR not suggestive of tumor and consequent hypercalcemia of malignancy. No protein gap. Further investigation for multiple myeloma was deemed inconsistent with new goals of care.

#) Hyponatremia: improved with judicious fluids, suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia. Probable component of poor solute intake too. Urine studies equivocal. 

#) Hyperkalemia: minor; no ECG changes. Due to ___. Improved with fluids and restoration of kidney function.

#) HTN: intermittently hypertensive to sBP 170; asymptomatic. Home carvedilol was increased to 12.5 QAM, 12.5 QPM with adequate effect. Home clonidine, amlodipine, hydralazine, Imdur were continued. Home lisinopril was held in the setting of ___.

#) Goals of care: after discussion with patient (when coherent), husband (proxy), palliative care, and SW, it was determined that frequent re-admissions and generalized aversion to hospitalization do not align with her preferences. She ultimately prefers to remain at home with adequate analgesia for her chronic left leg/lumbar back pain. Code status amended to DNR/DNI.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: #) Back pain/left leg pain: patient previously on methadone 5 mg TID, which was discontinued by PCP for long QT. It was learned that patient subsequently obtained methadone via sharing at home. Palliative care recommended low-dose opioid as needed for pain management. Patient did not have evidence of opioid withdrawal.

#) Normocytic, normochromic anemia: suspect patient arrived hemoconcentrated from poor oral intake. Subsequent decline was thus due to hemodilution after volume expansion. . . Transitional Issues ============= []Home with hospice services []Consider further discontinuation of medicines to align with goals of care . . .
