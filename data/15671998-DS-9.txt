There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Assessment:  3 vessel CAD with patent SVG to OM and LIMA to LAD  Occlusion of SVG to RCA as culprit for STEMI  Successful DES to native RCA  ASA 81mg daily and Plavix 75mg daily  Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: ___ yo female with history of CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN p/w STEMI with thrombosis of SVG to RCA now s/p placement of DES to the RCA.   . Active Issues: # STEMI: Patient was transferred to ___ from ___ where she had presented with chest pain with EKG concerning for interior STEMI. She was started on a heparin drip, plavix loaded and underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 3-vessel disease and thrombosis of her SVG to the RCA. Her LIMA graph and SVG to OM were patent. She underwent placement of one DES to her native RCA with restoration of flow. The patient tolerated the procedure well with impovement in ST elevations on her EKG. Troponin and CK were noted to peak at 1.24 and 350 (CK-MB 46) and then trend downward. She initally had ___ residual chest pain after the cath which resolved the following morning. She remained chest pain free for the remainder of the admission.  She should continue taking plavix 75mg PO daily for at least one year and aspirin 325mg daily indefinitely. She was also started on atorvastatin 80mg daily.   .  # Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF: Pt reports history of CHF requiring home lasix. She was clinically volume overloaded on exam, with elevated JVP and crackles on lung exam and had a chest xray showing pulmonary edema. She received gentle hydration post catheterization for renal protection in addition to 2 units of PRBCs for anemia as described below. She was then diuresed with bolus doses of 20 mg IV lasix with good response. Echo on HD 1 showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and preserved LVEF of 55-60%. She appeared clinically euvolemic at the time of discharge. . # Sinus Bradycardia- At the time of admission the patient was noted to be in sinus bradycardia with heart rates in the low to mid ___. Given her recent MI there was some concern for involvement of her conduction system. Her beta blocker was initially held however she was restarted on a decreased does of PO metoprolol (25 mg BID from 50 mg TID at home) and maintained heart rates of 55-60. . # Hx Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has history of afib previously on coumadin which was stopped a year ago for unknown reasons. The patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization and was continued on her home amiodarone. Electrolytes were repleted as needed. Her beta blocker was initially held in the setting of bradycardia but was restarted at a reduced dose on HD 1 as stated above.  . # Microcytic anemia: Pt was anemic on admission with a Hct of 23.1. Iron studies were consistent with iron deficieny anemia with a low iron, low normal ferritin and high normal TIBC. The patinent denied any clear source of bleeding including bright red blood per rectum, melena or hemoptysis. She was transfused 2 units of PRBCs with appropriate response in her HCT and HCT remained stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization. She should start iron supplementation and have an outpatient colonoscopy in 3 months to evaluate for possible GI source of bleed.  . # ___ : On admission the pts creatinine noted to be elevated to 2.3. Her baseline Cr is unknown however patient is not aware of known renal dysfunction. She was given gental IVF for renal protection in the post-cath setting in addition to the blood transfusion described above. Her home lisinopril was initally held in the setting of acute kidney injury. Her creatinine remained stable over the course of her hospitalization and was 2.0 at the time of discharge. Her lisinopril and potassium supplements were discontinued. She should have repeat labs drawn on ___ with labs sent to her primary care provider for continued monitoring of her renal function and to determine whether she can restart her lisinopril. . Stable Issues: . # COPD: Pt with history of COPD not on home oxygen but with new oxygen requirement on admission, thought likely ___ pulmonary edema and not a COPD exacerbation. She was diuresed as above and weaned off oxygen. At the time of discharge she was maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air. . # DMII- The patients home glipizide was held in the setting of elevated creatinine. Glucose control was maintained with sliding scale insulin throughout her admission. . # Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home levothyroxine dose of 100mcg PO daily.  .  # HTN- Her home lisinopril and metoprolol were initially held, and she was restarted on a lower dose of metoprolol on HD as above.  . #Transitional issues- - She maintained full code status throughout admission. - She should continue plavix 75mg daily for at least one year and ASA 325mg indefinitely. - She was started on high dose atorvastatin (80mg PO daily). - Her metoprolol dose was decreased from 50mg TID to 25mg BID due to sinus bradycardia (HR ___. - She will need repeat labs next week to monitor renal function with results sent to her PCP. - Lisinopril and potassium supplements were discontinued due to her renal failure. She should follow up with her PCP regarding whether to resume these medications. - Patient will need to continue iron supplements for her iron deficiency anemia and schedule outpatient colonoscopy in 3 months.
