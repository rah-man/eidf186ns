 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with a PMH notable for JRA, cellulitis, and recurrent UTIs, who presented with fever to 100.4, nausea, vomiting, and confusion, found to have bacteremia with oxacillin-resistant Staph epidermidis, a possibly new CN VI palsy, and MRI findings equivocal for septic emboli.

# Bacteremia: Mr. ___ presented with fevers, nausea, vomiting and confusion and his blood culture ___ grew oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Aerococcus viridans. Bacteremia was presumed to be a urinary source from Foley manipulation, but could also be from cellulitis. Surveillance blood cultures were all negative. During his hospitalization, patient was noticed to have a left abducens palsy, and because of this team was concerned for septic emboli. MRI was ordered and patient found to have a lesion that could or could not have been a result of septic emboli, however did not explain the palsy. Neurology was consulted, and decision was made that patient needed to be evaluated for endocarditis in the setting of bacteremia and possible septic emboli. TTE was done, but was inconclusive because of his body habitus. The goal then was to do a TEE for further evaluation. However, patient had a history of esophageal stricture from EGD in ___, and the TEE team felt uncomfortable doing the TEE until GI had determined it was safe. GI was consulted, did EGD, confirmed it was safe to do the TEE. Patient had the TEE done, and no vegetations were found. 

Patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and then transitioned to vancomycin IV after blood culture results + sensitivities returned. However, he lost IV access. The IV nurse was unable to get access. ___ team was unable to get access. Patient needed IV antibiotics as we were treating for suspected endocarditis, and he needed access so the TEE and EGD could be performed. Interventional radiology was consulted to place a PICC vs. a tunneled line if they were unable to get a PICC. Right femoral tunneled line was placed prior to TEE and EGD, and then pulled prior to discharge. 

As mentioned above, patient was being treated with IV vancomycin, and after negative TEE was discharged with PO linezolid to complete a total 3 week course per ID recommendations. Of note, patient previously had been on methadone for pain control prior to admission, but was not getting it during hospitalization and pain was controlled. He was not continued on methadone post discharge because of the concern for serotonin syndrome in combination with linezolid. 

# UTI: As above, febrile to 100.4F x1 prior to admission and had leukocytosis up to 14.8. He had a positive UA upon admission, and urine culture that grew mixed flora. Patient had a chronic indwelling foley, and infection was thought to be a result of manipulation of the catheter. The team reached out to his primary urologist to determine if suprapubic catheter would be a safer option in terms of infection, and the decision was made that keep the indwelling foley was the safest and most appropriate management at this time. Antibiotic treatment was as above.

# Cellulitis: Patient initially presented with very erythematous, tender, nonpustular left lower extremity. He was treated with the antibiotics (ceftriaxone and then vancomycin) as per above, and the erythema and tenderness significantly improved. We drew a line around the cellulitis to ensure it did not grow out of it, and the cellulitis only continued to shrink with treatment.

#Hypertension: During hospitalization patient was found to be hypertensive, with some systolic blood pressures in the 180s-190s. He was asymptomatic during this time. We started him on amlodipine 5 mg, and then increased it to 10 mg po daily and his systolic blood pressures improved to the 110s-140s.

# CN VI Palsy: Per the patient's nursing aid, his CN VI palsy appeared the day before admission, and she had never noticed them before. He had no other focal neurologic deficits. Patient had an MRI done, and as mentioned above, there were no findings that explained this palsy. We came to the conclusion that the patient had likely had the palsy for a while, and it was only noticed during his acute illness as people were paying closer attention to his physical exam. Patient was discharged with neuroophthalmology follow-up.

#MRI findings: The patient initially had an MRI of his brain because of the CN VI palsy and concern for septic emboli. After the official read of the MRI, and then again rereading it with the team and the radiology attendings, the findings were determined to be equivocal for septic embolus vs thromboembolus. The patient also has chronic vessel disease, likely from longstanding hypertension. Neurology was consulted and recommended stroke prevention work up. A1c was <6.5, lipids ordered and LDL 93, HDL 51. He was started on atorvastatin 80 mg po qhs, but not started on aspirin because of history of allergy. In addition, he was treated with amlodipine for blood pressure control. Patient was discharged with neurology follow up.

# ___: During hospitalization, the patient had ___ with creatinine peak to 1.4, and then came down to fluctuate between ___ (baseline 1), with BUNs in the low ___. His initial ___ was attributed to prerenal causes in the setting of vomiting, and then to poor PO intake. Patient and nursing team were encouraged to push PO fluid intake, and creatinine remained stable with BUN decreasing closer to normal. 

CHRONIC ISSUES  # Hypothyroidism: We continued home Synthroid. # Iron Deficiency Anemia: Monitored CBC, H/H relatively stable during admission, fluctuating between 10.6-12. Continued home iron. # ___: Stable during admission. Continued famotidine/omeprazole/sucralfate. # JRA/Chronic Pain: Continued oxycodone for pain control. Did not continue methadone, and pain was well controlled. Not discharged with methadone because discharged with linezolid and the combination can cause serotonin syndrome.

Transitional Issues: # Do not give patient methadone while he is on linezolid for four week (End date ___ # Patient very difficult to obtain IV access in, keep in mind for treatment future # Neuroophthalmology f/u with Dr. ___ # Neurology f/u for previous strokes/chronic ischemic vessel disease # CODE STATUS: Full # CONTACT: ___ ___ (caregiver); ___ ___ caregiver. ___ (sister) ___  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a a pleasure caring for you at ___ ___. You were admitted for an infection of your blood, which we thought arose from your urine. You also had an infection of the soft tissue of your leg. You were treated with antibiotics for the infection of your blood, urine and leg, and you improved. Because you had an infection in your blood, and a possible new problem with movement of your left eye, we were concerned for an infection in the heart. While you were hospitalized we looked at your heart and there was no infection there. You will be discharged with medication called linezolid to take for your blood infection. You should take this every day, twice a day, for three weeks. It is very important you do not take methadone with this medication, as it can cause a dangerous reaction. ****We have prescribed you this medication, but we are working with your insurance to get it approved. You have enough medication to take until ___. But then must go back to the pharmacy with the prescription we gave you to get the new prescription to finish the course***

You were seen by our neurologists and ophthalmologists for your eyes. We did an MRI of your brain, and found some old and new changes, which are essentially small prior strokes. However, no changes on the brain MRI explained your left eye problem. As we discussed, this is probably a chronic problem that you have had, and someone just recently noticed. You will follow up with the neurologist in the clinic.

In addition, while you were hospitalized we noticed your blood pressures were high. We started you on a blood pressure medication called amlodipine, and your blood pressures improved. You will be discharged with this medication.

If you start to develop fevers, worsening pain or redness of your leg, or new focal neurologic symptoms, please seek medical attention.  Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed. Your follow-up appointments are outlined below.

We wish you all the very best!

Warmly, Your ___ Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
