 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with history prior ischemic strokes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease s/p angioplasty who is referred from neurology clinic for stroke work up. On ___, he had dinner and a couple of drinks (3, gin and vodka). He felt more intoxicated than expected and he fell asleep in a chair. Patient woke up 5 minutes later and said, "what is that screen?" Patient does not remember saying this, per wife, there was no scrren. Then, he tried to speak but could not get the words. He knew what he wanted to say but could not say it. Comprehension was intact. He did "stroke stuff" with his family, which was fine per their report. Patient had difficulty walking, unclear if this was due to intoxication, no clear focal weakness. Poor balance at baseline, it was worse, but not falling to the right or the left. Mr. ___ felt overall unwell and went to sleep. On ___, symptoms persisted, but had some improvement and could say words and short sentences but with difficulty. On ___, had some more improvement, and today almost back to baseline. Per wife, he made no paraphasic errors, comprehension was intact. Speech was dysarthric and somewhat stuttering. Still has some mild difficulty getting the words out. Walking is more or less back to baseline, a little slower. Of note, pt was seen in neurology clinic ___ after a fall with head strike and at that time mentioned some word finding difficulty.

Over the last couple of weeks, patient has hallucinated a lady that would come to him and bow, saw this a few times. Knew that it was not real. Also, recently, sugar levels have been in 400-500 for the last few weeks. Did not inform PCP.

Mr. ___ had a stroke several years ago in the right cerebellum which presented with nausea, vomiting, vertigo and gait unsteadiness with no residual deficits. At that time, he was found to have a older stroke on an MRI scan in the R occipital/parietal region, but does not remember any symptoms or deficits from that. He was started on Plavix at the time of the stroke and has continued it with no further neurologic events until this ___.

Patient was seen in neurology clinic by Drs. ___ today. At that time, he had mild difficulty with naming/repetition, for example, instead of repeating "no ifs ands or buts" he said "no ifs ands buts."  He had increased tone throughout, but no asymmetry, no weakness. 

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

 BRAIN MRI: An small area of slow diffusion is seen in the right cerebellum approaching the right cerebellum peduncle compatible with an acute infarct. There are areas of encephalomalacia in the right parietal lobe and the right cerebellum consistent with old infarcts. Periventricular and subcortical white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are likely sequelae from chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age related global atrophy. There is no mass, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.   MRA HEAD: The inferior M2 segment of the left MCA as well as bilateral PCAs appear diminutive, which could be artifactual in nature or due to atherosclerotic disease. The remaining intracranial vessels demonstrate normal opacification without significant narrowing or stenosis.  No aneurysm or other vascular abnormality is identified.    MRA NECK: There is focal signal dropout at the origin of the left internal carotid artery with moderate narrowing likely secondary to atherosclerotic disease. Irregularities of the proximal right internal carotid artery are also likely due to atherosclerotic disease, but there is no high-grade stenosis or occlusion. Bilateral vertebral arteries are patent without stenosis or occlusion.   IMPRESSION:   1. Acute right cerebellum infarct near the cerebellar peduncle.  Areas of encephalomalacia in the right parietal lobe and the right cerebellum corresponding to prior infarcts.     2. Diminutive left inferior M2 branch and bilateral PCAs likely due to motion artifact or atherosclerotic disease. No aneurysm or other vascular abnormality is seen.   3. Focal signal dropout at the origin of the left internal carotid artery with moderate narrowing likely secondary to atherosclerotic disease.  Irregularities at the proximal right internal artery are present without high-grade stenosis or occlusion. Recommend follow up with head and neck CTA for further evaluation. 

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to the stroke service following difficulty with speech and with gait. His symptoms improved back to baseline during the admission. He underwent an MRI which showed a small stroke in the right pons, which was the likely cause of his symptoms. This stroke was likely secondary to medium vessel disease in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes. His HbA1c was 10. He was noted to ambulate well with cane.

No medication changes were made.

He was sent home with stroke clinic and primary care follow up. Primary care physician was made aware of admission.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the stroke service for speech and walking difficulties. You were found to have a small stroke in your right cerebellum. This was likely the cause of your symptoms. Your stroke is likely due to chronic vessel disease, which is caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. It is important that you follow up with your primary care doctor as scheduled for these issues. You will also follow up in neurology clinic as below.

Please continue all of your medications as previously prescribed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you during this hospital stay.  Followup Instructions: ___
