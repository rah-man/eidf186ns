Psychopharm: Patient was initiated on sertraline 25 mg for depression and anxiety, and this was ultimately titrated to 50 mg daily. Pt tolerated this well and denied major side effects. Patient's xanax was titrated down from 2 mg qid to 0.5 mg bid over the course of two weeks because of patient's advanced age and report of sedation. Her sedation improved as the xanax was downtitrated. It was noted that her blood pressure was elevated as the xanax was downtitrated, so her anti-hypertensive was increased (see medical section).

Behavior: Upon admission, patient stated that she was depressed, anxious, and hopeless regarding her situation. She initially endorsed passive SI but was able to contract for safety and stated she would not do anything to hurt herself on the unit. After several days, she stated she was feeling much better and was no longer having thoughts of passive SI. Her mood improved with titration of sertraline. She reported improved sleep quality and decreased anxiety. 

She confirmed that upon arrival in ___ from ___, when she and her son were unable to secure shelter placement in ___, she expressed a desire to kill herself by walking into traffic. She denied actually having tried to walk into traffic.

Throughout the hospitalization, patient was extremely pleasant, attended groups, and engaged appropriately in the milieu. No behavioral issues.

The inpatient team spoke with the patient's outpatient therapist in ___, Dr. ___, whom she had seen for ___ years. Dr. ___ reported that the patient and her son have a very enmeshed relationship, and that the patient sometimes reaches a point of expressing suicidal ideation out of frustration with her son, who experiences frequent suicidal ideation. 

Psychosocial: The inpatient team stayed in regular contact with the patient's son, ___, who was simultaneously hospitalized at another local psychiatric ___ ___ ___. We also stayed in contact with her son's inpatient team at ___. ___ reported he was being discharged on ___ and had found a room in the ___ area where both he and his mother could he stay.

Medical: Pt was continued on her home blood pressure medication, benazepril. However, she was noted to have elevated blood pressures in the 160s-170s systolic for several days, possibly related to the ongoing down-titration of xanax. We then decided to increase her standing benazepril from 20 mg to 30 mg. She appeared to tolerate this well and her SBP decreased to the 150s range. Recommend continued close monitoring of BP upon discharge.
