IMAGING: ================== CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Hyperdensity overlying the vertebrae of the lower thoracic spine may represent osseous metastatic disease. Superimposed pulmonary abnormality such as pneumonia or nodule cannot be excluded.

MRI Spine ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive osseous metastatic disease. No associated pathologic compression fracture 2. There is an area of T2 area of signal abnormality in the dorsal spinal canal at the C5 level, without convincing enhancement. It is of uncertain etiology and small metastatic focus is not excluded in the context of the fairly extensive metastases although it does not clearly enhance. Further assessment from high-resolution targeted imaging of the cervical spine may be useful. It does not cause definite compression of the spinal cord, although of note, there is spinal cord edema at C3 through C5 without enhancement, near the indeterminate focus of signal abnormality. 3. Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy likely reflecting metastatic disease. 4. Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the spine most pronounced in the lower lumbar spine with severe neural foraminal narrowing at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels as well as severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5. PREVALENCE: Prevalence of lumbar degenerative disk disease in subjects without low back pain: Overall evidence of disk degeneration 91% (decreased T2 signal, height loss, bulge) T2 signal loss 83% Disk height loss 58% Disk protrusion 32% Annular fissure 38% Jarvik, et all. Spine ___ 26(10):1158-1166 Lumbar spinal stenosis prevalence- present in approximately 20% of asymptomatic adults over ___ years old ___, et al, Spine Journal ___ 9 (7):___  These findings are so common in asymptomatic persons that they must be interpreted with caution and in context of the clinical situation.

L SPINE FLEX and EXT: ___ IMPRESSION: Anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 without change in alignment between flexion and extension. Degenerative changes. Multifocal sclerotic lesions concerning for metastatic disease.

HIP X-RAY ___: IMPRESSION: No previous images. There are multiple areas of sclerosis involving the visualized lumbar vertebral bodies as well as several bones of the pelvis, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer. Substantial hypertrophic spurring and intervertebral disc space narrowing is consistent with degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine. Relatively mild degenerative changes in the left hip joint, symmetric with the appearance on the right. No evidence of fracture. However, if an occult fracture is a serious clinical concern, MRI could be obtained.

CT CHEST ___: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary parenchymal findings. 2. Moderate emphysema. 7 mm nodule versus component of subpleural scarring in the right apex, and a additional bilateral pulmonary nodules.  In this patient with underlying emphysema, ___ noncontrast CT of the chest in ___ months is recommended. 3. Ill-defined lesion measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.4 x 2.4 cm in the hepatic dome, which should be further characterized with multiphasic CT or MRI of the liver. 4. Diffuse sclerosis of the T9 and T10 vertebral bodies, also partially involving the posterior elements. Additional sclerotic lesions in other thoracic vertebral bodies, as well as partially imaged in the L1 vertebral body. Findings are concerning for blastic metastases.  RECOMMENDATION(S): 1. Noncontrast CT of the chest in ___ months. 2. Multiphasic CT or MRI of the liver.

KUB ___: IMPRESSION: Nonspecific, nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. Sclerosis of multiple vertebral bodies and left iliac bone compatible with known metastatic disease.

 Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: ===================== Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with PMHx HTN, T2DM, CKD and castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer currently being treated with taxotere/prednisone s/p cycle 7 day 1 (___) who presents from ___ facility with left leg pain/numbness and tingling, low-grade fevers and hyperkalemia. He underwent MRI, which demonstrated C5 signal abnormality and C3-5 edema without enhancement, as well as narrowing and stenosis of the lumbar spine, but after neurosurgery evaluation, there was no concern for acute cord compression and his weakness was felt to be due to peripheral neuropathy with L4 nerve compression and subsequent foot drop. He underwent pelvic/hip x-ray without acute fracture. He remained afebrile, but given neutropenia and fevers to 104, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime before transitioning to augmentin to complete a course until ___. Given new hemoptysis, there was concern for possible TB in the setting of a number of risk factors, but workup was negative for active TB. Also complicated by SIADH, thus encouraged fluid restriction. He was evaluated by the physical therapists who recommended rehab, and he was discharged to ___ with oncology and PCP ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] Assess adherence to fluid restriction, re-check sodium in 3d given evidence of SIADH. If having worsening hyponatremia or unable to adhere to fluid restriction, consider nephrology evaluation [] Assess Cr & BUN in 3d given fluid restriction [] Final results Quant gold needs to be followed up [] Noted to have 3.4 cm nodule in hepatic dome noted on imaging, will need multiphasic CT or MRI of liver for ___ [] Patient needs repeat noncontrast CT of the chest in ___ months. [] As per neurosurgery, patient may benefit from lumbar spine decompression, but this can be done on an elective outpatient basis [] Held pt's glyburide as dose unknown, please determine if this medication is still necessary

[] Oncology: - Given extent of metastatic disease, patient may benefit from PET/CT and further prognostication as well as ongoing ___ discussions - Per radiology read of MRI, patient may benefit from further assessment from high-resolution targeted imaging of the cervical spine

ACTIVE ISSUES: ====================== # Prostate Cancer # Osseous Metastases # L leg weakness Pt with hx castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer currently being treated with taxotere/prednisone s/p cycle 7 day 1 (___). Given left leg symptoms, there was initially concern for cord compression. Exam was notable for decrease dorsiflexion of the left foot, but the remainder of the exam was within normal limits. He underwent MRI of the spine which demonstrated extensive osseous metastatic disease without evident pathologic fracture and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. They also noted C5 signal abnormality and C3-5 edema without enhancement, as well as narrowing/stenosis in lumbar spine. He was evaluated by Spine who recommended no emergent intervention, and this was ultimately felt to be a peripheral process with L4 nerve compression and subsequent foot drop. Given hip pain, he underwent X-ray, which did not show acute fracture, although notable for sclerosis c/w metastases, and mild degenerative changes of the left hip. Heme/onc was consulted and the patient was continued on his home enzalutamide 160mg PO daily (after missing 3 doses due to transportation issue) as well as prednisone 10mg PO QAM and 5mg PO QPM. He was evaluated by the physical therapists who recommended physical therapy at ___, but he may also benefit from directed therapy of his now known foot drop. He will ___ with his outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___ he would benefit from an ongoing ___ discussion given the extent of his disease. He also would benefit from further assessment of his cervical spine disease with high-resolution targeted imaging as well imaging his 3.4 cm nodule in hepatic dome noted on imaging with multiphasic CT or MRI of liver.

# Hemoptysis # Neutropenia Pt currently undergoing chemotherapy with WBC 2.4 and ANC 1030 that nadired during this hopstilaizaiton at 730. He Reports a temp 104 last week, however has had low-grade temps more recently and was found to have Tmax 99 here. Given productive cough and CXR w/ hyperdensity overlying the vertebrae of the lower thoracic spine, concernign for metastases versus pneumonia, he was initially treated with vancomycin/cefepime for concern for neutorpenic fever before transitioning to augmentin after remaining afebrile/hemodynamically stable to complete a course until ___. During the hospitalization, he developed multiple episodes of hemoptysis as well as night sweats and given his number of risk factors (incarcerated, ?positive PPD, immunosuppresion), he was isolated and underwent expectorated sputum for AFB + MTB direct amp, which was unrevealing. The Quant-Gold was drawn, but is still pending. He had CT contrast of the chest that demonstrated no acute pulmonary parenchymal findings with moderate emphysema and was noted to have a 7 mm nodule versus component of subpleural scarring in the right apex, and additional bilateral pulmonary nodules. He should have repeat CT imaging of the chest in ___ months.

# Hyperkalemia, resolved: Pt with reports of hyperK at ___, treated with Ca, insulin/dextrose, albuterol. His potassium remained wnl at ___, and no further intervention was pursued.

# Anemia: Hgb was between 7.9-8.3 this admission, which appears to be close to baseline based upon review of records. This has been worked up as an outpatient and he is on home ferrous sulfate 325 BID, but there is likely a component of anemia of chronic disease. Held iron while inpatient d/t concern for constipation, okay to resume upon discharge. His home naproxen was initially held in the setting of concern for bleeding, but it was continued on discharge.
