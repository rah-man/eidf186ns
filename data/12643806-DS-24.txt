Assessment and Plan: 

# Bilateral Leg Pain: The patient has a history of multiple sclerosis and has had chronic bilateral leg spasms which have acutely worsened. The patient does get relief from oxycodone PRN, but has nausea with it. The chronic pain team recommended baclofen and tizanidine. If these medications are too sedating, then she should take tizanidine at night only. Oxycodone should be avoided unless she doesn't have any pain relief. She needs to be pre-medicated for nausea about 30 -60 mins before oxycodone. Another option for pain control would be low dose Valium at night. She has a followup appointment with the chronic pain clinic. 

# Failure to thrive: The daughter noted that her mother was failing to live at home. She had 24 hour care and felt that it was not optimal.

# Inflammatory polyarthritis: The patient has a history of osteoarthritis. Her ESR/CRP were elevated on this admission. Her rheumatologist was contated and she said she had chronically elevated ESR/CRP and would not recommend increasing her prednisone further than 5 mg. Clinically, her knees appeared non-inflammed. The DIP, PIP joints in her left hand were inflammed.

# Interstitial lung disease: Patient with multiple reasons for SOB/tachypnea including interstitial lung disease, restrictive lung disease, pain in her chest that appears to restrict her breathing, anxiety and dCHF. PE ruled out by CTA. No pleural effusion or pulmonary edema seen on chest imaging and BNP low in ED, so acute CHF exacerbation unlikely. Patient appears anxious when feels SOB and breathes heavily. The patient has a history of interstitial lung disease and on exam she has crackles/wheezing. She should continue oxygen as needed (was on 1.5 liters at home). Also, if she has symptomatic relief, would continue albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers. .  #Right sided chest pain: The patient had right sided pleuritic chest pain. She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction (CE x2 negative, no EKG changes, no telemetry changes). Her pain is likely musculoskeletal, on tylenol for pain control. Not consistent with cardiac chest pain. 

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: LVEF=55% on past Echo. Euvolemic on exam. Will continue home lasix.  # Diabetes mellitus II, controlled: Blood glucose well-controlled.

# Sacral Decubitus ulcer, Stage II: Patient has on arrival to the hospital. Wound care provided to the area. 

# Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin.   # Multiple sclerosis: Stable. No current treatment.
