Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of ___ 7:52:14 ___ 

Sinus tachycardia, rate 103. Otherwise, normal tracing. No previous tracing available for comparison.   Radiology Report ART EXT (REST ONLY) Study Date of ___ 4:28 ___ IMPRESSION: Moderately severe bilateral lower extremity occlusive disease with SFA, popliteal and tibial occlusions on the right and mild iliac and moderately severe tibial disease on the left. Right-sided metatarsal PVR waveform is nearly aphasic. 

ANKLE (2 VIEWS) LEFT Study Date of ___ 4:52 ___ There is significant amount of subcutaneous air along the lateral malleolus and distal tibia. There is also soft tissue swelling. There is questionable bone destruction along the mid aspect of the lateral malleolus that might be consistent with osteomyelitis, although the findings are minimal and should be reevaluated by MRI or nuclear scan. There are degenerative changes of the calcaneus. No other abnormality is demonstrated. 

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 4:52 ___ The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal position, contour and width are unremarkable. Left lung is essentially clear. In the right lung base there is a opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragm with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, that is continuing with the hilus and might represent a combination of atelectasis and infectious process.   Followup of the patient after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended for documentation of resolution. If findings persist evaluation with chest CT might be considered to exclude the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia. 

Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:58:27 AM    FINAL Conclusions  The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. 

ECG Study Date of ___ 3:07:04 AM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ atrial fibrillation has appeared. There is delayed precordial R wave transition.   VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) Study Date of ___ 3:47 ___ FINDINGS: RIGHT: The right greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters from ankle to knee of 2.6, 2.8, 3.7, 4.1. Diameters from knee to groin are 3.6, 3.7, 4.6 mm respectively. LEFT: The left greater saphenous is patent. Diameters from ankle to knee are 4.6, 3.3, 3.2, 4.0, 3.5 mm. From the knee to the groin the diameters are 3.7, 3.2, 3.1, 6.2 mm. IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with diameters as noted above. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ Patient was transfered to ___ surgery from OSH for left lateral ankle and right medial ankle non-healing ulcers. Started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl). Routine nursing, labs and wound care. Foot x-rays-bone destruction along mid aspect of lateral maleolus c/w osteomyelitis. NIAS- was done, showed bilateral lower extremity occlusive disease with SFA, popliteal and tibial occlusions on the right and mild iliac and moderately severe tibial disease on the left. Right-sided metatarsal PVR waveform is nearly aphasic. CXR -right lung base there is a opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragm with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, that is continuing with the hilus and might represent a combination of atelectasis and infectious process. On admission patient's WBC was elevated, blood cultures were sent. 

___ Patient had debridement of the left lateral ulcer, cultures were sent. Continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, and wound care. Blood cultures came back negative. Continued to trend ___'s.

___ Patient continued on antibiotics, wound care. Patient went into atrial fibrillation-new onset for patient, confirmed by ECG. patient was placed on Diltizem drip ovenright, converted to NSR the next day. Cardiology consulted-recs to d/c Diltiazem and start low dose Lopressor PO, to titrate up w/ goal HR of 60-80 BPM. Patient was pre-oped and consented for BLE angiograms. made NPO post MN and IV hydrated.

___ Patient was taken to angio suite and underwent B/L ___ angiograms w/ bilateral common iliac artery stent placement. Detremined to need R Fem-pop bypass in the future. Patient recovered then transferred back to floor, was on bedrest for the prescribed amount of time. PO meds and diet resumed, post hydration was also given. Continued w/ wound care.

___ No acute events. Continued to trend ___'s. Wound cultures came back Staph coag + sensitive to most antibiotics inclusing Bactrim. Switched antibiotics to Bactrim. Physical therapy consult-recs d/c to rehab. Rehab screening requested.

___ No acute events, awaiting placement. ___ Discharged to extended care facility in good condition. Will be re-admitted early next week for bypass surgery. Patient will call Dr. ___ for details of admission.
