ECG ___: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats and first degree A-V block. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay of the left bundle-branch block type. Cannot exclude an inferior myocardial infarction. Poor R wave progression could be due to intraventricular conduction delay but cannot exclude an anterior myocardial infarction. Possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ ventricular premature beat is new. There is loss of R wave in leads V4-V6 which could be due to lead placement. 

MRCP ___: Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, with relatively smooth tapering of distal CBD in its superior intrapancreatic portion. No current evidence of obstructing choledocholithiasis. While the appearance is more suggestive of a benign stricture from passed stones or sequelae of prior pancreatitis (though there is no evidence of acute or chronic pancreatitis), a cholangiocarcinoma remains a consideration that must be excluded. Recommend ERCP for decompression, stone removal, and obtaining brush sampling. Markedly distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall irregularity and one area concerning for evolving ischemic gallbladder wall. 

ERCP: ___ Major Papilla: Normal major papilla Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.  Biliary Tree: A single stricture that was 2 cm long was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct. There was moderate post-obstructive dilation. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush from the CBD stricture. A 7cm by ___ Cotton ___ biliary stent was placed successfully.  Impression: Normal major papilla A single stricture that was 2 cm long was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct. There was moderate post-obstructive dilation.  A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.  Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush from the CBD stricture.  A 7cm by ___ Cotton ___ biliary stent was placed successfully 

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with multiple medical problems directly admitted from ___'s office for evaluation of intermittent dark urine and dyspepsia, for evaluation by ERCP. 

Intrahepatic ductal/CBD dilation: Seen by ERCP on ___, recommended MRCP on ___, reversal of INR, and ERCP (potentially on ___ for evaluation of bile duct dilatation. Had MRCP on ___, demonstrating cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, with markedly distended CBD and gallbladder. GB wall irregular, may be ischemic, with a sharp tapering of the CBD just proximal to the pancreatic duct. Seen by surgery, who recommended ERCP with brushings to evaluate smooth tapering (?malignancy). s/p ERCP on ___, with sphincterotomy and stent placement, brushings demonstrated adeno carcinoma. No anticoagulation x 72 hours after procedure. Will need replacement of plastic stent with a metal stent in the future (currently scheduled for ___ with Dr. ___.

Adenocarcinoma: Etiology unclear, likely cholangiocarcinoma v pancreatic cancer. Oncology evaluated patient and did not feel he was a candidate for chemotherapy given age and comorbidities. Also not a surgical candidate, discussed with surgery attending, in addition, patient and family not interested in surgery. Palliative Care service was consulted as well. Family is considering hospice care as an outpatient, have been given a list of potential hospice providers. A family meeting was held with Dr. ___ care), Dr. ___, myself (hospitalist/inpatient attending), social work, the patients wife and daughter in law. At this time, the family felt strongly about not telling the patient about his diagnosis. However, they want to tell him themselves after they get home. They will continue to discuss this with Dr. ___ as an outpatient and all the medical providers present at the meeting offered assistance with this. In general, we encouraged them to disclose this information to him and it was decided that if the patient inquires about his diagnosis while he is here, that these questions will be answered.

Atrial fibrillation on warfarin: Received 2mg PO vitamin K x 3 for INR reversal on ___ and ___. Also with many alarms on telemetry for "ventricular tachycardia", felt by EP team to be supraventricular with rate-related aberrancy. Amiodarone (stopped per primary cardiologist in the setting of elevated transaminases) then restarted. Coumadin restarted on ___, also started on lovenox given high ___ score and newly diagnosed malignancy for bridging until therapeutic on coumadin. goal inr ___

Delirium: Noted to be substantially delirious overnight, especially in the early morning, refusing medications, thought secondary to benzodiazepene withdrawal, sundowning, and acute hospitalization and reversal of day/night. Started on low-dose seroquel on ___ with improvement. Per request of family and home care giver, ativan changed to tid and quetiapine to ___ dose. Patient tolerated this well and although he had intermittent episodes of confusion, his mental status was much improved by the time of discharge. The wife was concerned about sedation with seroquel, I explained that this can be tapered at home as needed (instructions on Rx), but that he was tolerating this well as an inpatient  Medications on Admission: Keppra 500mg BID Ativan 0.25mg Q4H while awake Amiodarone 100mg alternating with 200mg every other day Sertraline Warfarin 1mg daily Omeprazole Advair Mirtazapine 7.5mg QHS Simvastatin Lisinopril 2.5mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
