 Name: ___           Unit No:  ___  Admission Date: ___       Discharge Date:  ___  Date of Birth: ___       Sex:  M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending: ___  Chief Complaint: Worsening headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: ___ year old right handed man with hypertension, smoker, COPD recently admitted (___) for right frontal IPH after he was noted to be "acting strange" who returns with headache, dysphagia and worsening Head CT as OSH. 

On ___, the wife reported he was acting strangely by forgeting to pay the ___ while having his truck serviced, sitting in his truck and not be conversational at a funeral. He presented to and OSH and Head CT showed a 3.4 cm x 4.6 cm right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with a 2mm right to left midline shift with effacement of the right ventricle. He was transferred to ___ and admitted to the ICU and then the floor on the stroke service. CTA showed no evidence of aneurysm, vascular stenosis or occlusion. MRI completed and showed some increase in edema and no evidence of underlying AVM or mass. Exam at that time was notable for periods of atrial fibrillation and abulia. The team suggested a Holter and an MRI prior to follow up with Dr. ___ in ___. Patient was discharged ___ and resumed aspirin ___. Wife reports he has been doing well and been fine. He was not incontinent at home which he had been in the hospital. He was swallowing and eating well. He had visitors and his wife reported he recognized everyone, but was not conversational with others and easily distracted. 

This morning he woke up with a "hell of a headache" at 7:00 am. He says it was bifrontal and nonradiating and he no longer has the headache in the ED. His wife gave him aspirin and diovan and he swallowed them without difficulty. Then his wife gave his multivitamin and he had trouble swallowing it. She then called EMS and their records indicate BP 142/80, 20, BS 106, placed on 3L nc. They reported ___ headache and he was transferred to OSH where vitals were T 97.8 P 79 irregular, RR 20, BP 135/75. CXRAY showed no acute change and hypoinflation. CT head repeated and they compared it to a study there ___ and noted significant worsening in edema and mass effect related to the right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (5.6 cm) with 10mm shift to the left.

He was transferred here and given fentanyl 50 mcg x 2 for headache en route. In the ED, BP 135/76 65 14 90% RA. EKG showed sinus bradycardia. He had a repeat Head CT which in review with neuroradiology it was felt there was rebleeding at the periphery of the initial hemorrhage with 15 mm subfalcine herniation. It was felt that this was a good presentation for amyloid angiopathy.

 Pertinent Results: ___ ___ Right frontal atypical rim of IPH and subcortical hypodensity (edema) both appear stable to me from ___ date ___. Potential underlying mass (will require reimaging with MRI months/weeks after discharge, after blood products resolve).

___ CT Head Right frontal acute on subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 

surrounding vasogenic edema and new leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately 15 mm; the likely etiology of hemorrhage is amyloid angiopathy. 

___ CXR No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ MRI Large predominantly subacute right frontal hematoma with significant peripheral edema causing stable 15 mm leftward subfalcine herniation, without evidence of transtentorial or tonsillar herniation. No new focus of hemorrhage. Areas of peripheral enhancement may be normal appearance of subacute hematoma; however, underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time. Continued followup to resolution is recommended. Unchanged from the MRI on ___.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr ___ is a patient who was recently discharged following a significant right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The etiology of his IPH is uncertain; although amyloid angiopathy is statistically most likely, the unusual arrangement of the blood and intervening edema raise the possibility of an underlying mass lesion. This possibility should be ruled out with follow up MRI after discharge, after blood obfuscation from products has resolved; during his previous admission MRI was unable to determine if there was an underlying mass or malformation due to the overlying hemorrhage. By discharge from that admission, he was stable, but significantly abulic with incontinence of bowel and bladder (he apparently was not bothered by this fact).

Now, he returned to the hospital with worsening of his abulia and significant headache and poor/no PO intake. CT mentioned a small amount of re-hemorrhage with an increased amount of edema. However, his repeat MRI did not demonstrate re-hemorrhage, however, he did have vasogenic edema surrounding the initial hemorrhage. His studies are most consistent with amyloid angiopathy as an underlying etiology, however, he will need a repeat MRI brain which has been scheduled for him, as blood products need to clear up before an underlying lesion can be excluded. He was diuresed with Lasix to be maintained net negative by 500mL per day, and HOB was kept >30deg. He was found to do better nutritionally with a ground diet mixed with broth, he needed to be supervised with meals and drinks, and likes chocolate boost.
