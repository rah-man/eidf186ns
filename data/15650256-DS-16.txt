====================== BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: ====================== ___ year old woman with non ischemic HFrEF (EF ___, CKD stage IV (s/p AV fistula ___, and DM who presents with bilateral lower extremity swelling, likely due to side effect of amlodipine as well as HFrEF exacerbation due to worsening renal function. Pt was diuresed with IV Lasix and her clinical status improved. She was seen by ___ who recommended ___ rehab.

# Bilateral lower extremity ___, due to: # Amlodipine adverse effect # Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure / nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF ___ The patient presented with bilateral leg swelling and mild JVP elevation. She denied orthopnea, shortness of breath, or chest pain. EKG was not concerning for ischemic/cardiac etiology and CXR showed ___ cardiopulmonary process. ___ edema likely primarily due to side effect from amlodipine as well as dietary indiscretion. Nephrology was consulted and recommended IV diuresis with 100mg IV furosemide with improvement in her clinical status. Her amlodipine was decreased from 10mg to 5mg. Given elevated blood pressures after this change, her hydralazine was increased from 75mg TID to ___ TID. She was continued on her home imdur and ivabradine, and losartan was given in lieu of home irbesartan (not on formulary). She was restarted on her home torsemide. She was also counseled on the importance of a low salt diet. Renal function remained at baseline. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization, and her lower extremity edema improved. She did complain of pain and weakness in her lower extremities, so ___ was consulted and recommended ___ rehabilitation.

#CKD stage IV: Recent fistula placed ___, currently maturing. Palpable thrill/audible bruit on exam. ___ acute RRT needs during this hospitalization. Creatinine increased slightly to 3.6 but this was around her baseline. Diuresis was administered as above. Intake and output was strictly monitored.

# Chronic microcytic anemia, due to: # Anemia of chronic renal failure / chronic inflammation: # Iron deficiency # B12 deficiency Hgb ranged from 7.1 to 8.0, which was slightly lower than the patient's baseline. Iron studies were consistent with both anemia of chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency (TSat 11%). She was given IV iron 250 mcg x2 prior to discharge. Supplemental B12 was also started given mild deficiency.

=============== CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # OSA: Home CPAP was continued.

# RA (RF+/CCP+): The patient was recently started recently on Leflunomide by Dr. ___ while inpatient. Continued home acetaminophen. 

# Hypothyroidism: TSH mildly elevated but FT4 normal - unlikely the etiology for her lower extremity edema. Patient was taking levothyroxine differently than prescribed - see transitional issues. Continued her dose as prescribed.
