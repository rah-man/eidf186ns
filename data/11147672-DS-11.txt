CT ABD/PELVIS w/o CONTRAST (___) 1. Large rounded stool in the distal rectum with mild adjacent wallthickening, which could reflect early stercoral colitis. 2. Incidental note of a more focal consolidation in the posterior left lowerlobe, for which developing infection is possible given the patient's clinicalhistory. Bibasilar atelectasis is dense. 3. Persistent 1.2 cm non-obstructing right lower renal stone. 4. Extensive polycystic kidney disease limiting evaluation forintra-abdominal fat stranding. 5. The known complex thoraco-abdominal aorta, SMA, and right iliac arterydissection is not well evaluated in the absence of IV contrast.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO (___) The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis.

CTA TORSO (___) 1. Multiple small fluid collections measuring up to 1.5 x 1.0 cm and inflammatory changes are adjacent to the thoracic ascending aorta and endovascular graft and raise concern for graft infection with small abscesses. 2. No evidence of psoas abscess. 3. The known complex thoracoabdominal aorta, SMA, and right iliac artery dissection is stable from CTA torso ___. 4. Polycystic kidney disease and nonobstructing renal stones are stable

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ man with h/o HTN, HLD, polycystic kidney disease, CKD (baseline Cr 1.2-1.3), and aortic dissection s/p repair who presented with fatigue and malaise and was found to have MRSA septicemia likely due to an infected ascending aortic graft vs. endocarditis. His hospital course was complicated by an acute on chronic kidney injury.

# MRSA Septicemia: Patient admitted for fatigue and malaise without any signs of sepsis. On admission, the patient's vitals were stable. His labs were remarkable for BUN/Cr 41/1.6 slightly elevated WBC 10.9, and H/H 10.2/30.8. Blood cultures were +ve for MRSA ___ bottles). ID was consulted. He was started on vancomycin 1g q12h. No port of entry could be identified on examination. The patient complained of bilateral ___ pain, so ABD/PLV CT was obtained to r/o psoas abscess that showed no sign of collection, but showed significant atelectasis at the lung bases (may be related to massive kidneys), extensive PCKD, large rounded stool in the distal rectum with developing stercoral colitis. Given patient's systolic murmur (baseline but cannot confirm if unchanged), TTE was obtained that did not show any valvular vegetations. A chest CTA was then done given the concern for infection of the aortic graft that showed multiple small fluid collections measuring up to 1.5 x 1.0 cm and inflammatory changes are adjacent to the thoracic ascending aorta and endovascular graft and raise concern for graft infection with small abscesses. Because of the proximity of the abscesses and the high suspicion of endocarditis, a TEE was ordered to evaluate the aortic valves, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure. Cardiac surgery was consulted following ID recs to replace graft. Patient was not deemed to be a surgical candidate, and ___ recommended medical management with follow-up imaging and re-evaluation after full course of IV antibiotics. Patient became culture negative on ___. His course was complicated by ___ ___ IV contrast vs. glomerulonephritis. Throughout his stay, the patient required constant adjustment of his vancomycin dosing with daily vancomycin levels because of his rapidly changing renal function. ID recommended a 6-week course of antibiotics from the day of first negative culture. Patient had a PICC line place on ___. At discharge, the patient's Cr had settled at 2.5-2.7, and per pharmacy recs, patient was discharged on vancomycin 500mg IV q72h. Patient d/ced with OPAT follow-up with weekly vancomycin levels, CBC, BUN, and Cr, and plan to re-adjust vancomycin dosing as needed. Final vanc level prior to discharge was 20.0.

# Acute Kidney Injury: The ___ hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury. He had an increase in serum creatinine on ___ to 1.3 up from 1.1 that continued to uptrend reaching a peak of 2.8 on ___. Patient did not responded to fluid boluses and became oliguric (200-300cc/24h). Nephrology was consulted and suggested following creatinine without intervention for now. The ___ was presumed to be related to either IV contrast following CTA with subsequent ATN or glomerulonephritis secondary to the MRSA bacteremia. Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to vancomycin was unlikely given lack of urine/serum eosinophilia. If glomerulonephritis, the patient would have benefited from steroids, but held off given concurrent infection. Nephro did not see any current need for hemodialysis. Patient was also in fluid overload that worsened following his ___. Patient was diuresed the last 2 days prior to discharge with a significant decrease in his ___. Patient's creatinine had leveled off prior to discharge and began decreasing with a creatinine on ___ of 2.5. His last day prior to discharge, the patient's urine output increased with diuresis (60 mg of furosemide + 60 mg torsemide) to 950cc/24h. He was d/ced on torsemide 60mg PO daily, and sodium bicarbonate 650 mg PO BID with plan for follow-up labs within ___ days.

# Anemia: Chronic anemia (since ___ with baseline hct ___, Hgb downtrended to (7.0 on ___. Patient has no signs or symptoms of active bleeding. He is hemodynamically stable. Likely anemia of chronic disease/renal insufficiency. Given the plan for d/c on ___, patient received 1U of PRBCs with 60 mg IV Lasix, with an appropriate increase in Hgb to 9.1 following the transfusion.

# Constipation: Patient with known chronic constipation, had CT abdomen/pelvis on admission that showed large 7.2 cm stool ball in the distal colon. Patient improved and was stooling regularly following aggressive bowel regimen. Started reporting loose/watery stools on ___. C.diff screen negative. Patient switched to PRN laxatives and diarrhea resolved.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ because you were feeling unwell and we discovered bacteria in your bloodstream called methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. To identify the source of this bacteria, we did a scan of your chest that showed abscesses around the graft that was used to fix the main blood vessel of your heart. We started you on an intravenous antibiotic called vancomycin. After we started you on this antibiotic your blood was cleared of this bacteria. You will need to take this antibiotic for at least 6 weeks, after which you may have to take a prolonged, or possibly lifelong course of oral antibiotics to suppress any bacteria that is left. 

During your hospitalization, your kidney function worsened. This may have been due to the existing infection or due to the dye that your received for your scan. We have been monitoring your kidney function and it has stabilized, but is not back to what it was before you came to the hospital. You will need to follow-up with a kidney specialist after your discharge to make sure your kidney function has not worsened and that you do not need new medications to treat your kidney problems.

We wish you a speedy recovery, Your ___ Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
