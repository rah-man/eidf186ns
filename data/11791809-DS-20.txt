 History of Present Illness: Ms ___ is a ___ yo right handed woman with a history of HTN, diabetes, paroxysmal A.fib on plavix (not coumadin due to history of GI bleed), remote hx of breast CA, and recent ___ Neurology admit in ___ for amaurosis fugax, who presents with one day of confusion.

According to the patient's daughter, this morning at 7:30 the patient developed a right-sided frontal headache. At the time this was felt to be one of her typical headaches. She was seen by her PCP for an already scheduled appointment, however felt well at that time. On the drive home with her son she began to be confused; for example when she arrived home in the driveway she did not realize she was at home and did not get out of the car. Throughout the day she continued to have trouble remembering the events of the day. She then tried to sit down in a chair (on her left side) but missed the chair and fell to the floor (denies head trauma or LOC). 

Her daughter brought her into the ED for evaluation. The patient says she feels at baseline and has no complaints. She denies new vision or balance problems. Her daughter says she's been holding onto objects while walking for the past month, but at baseline walks independently. 

In the ED a head CT revealed a hypodensity in the right occipital lobe, new from ___. Neurology was consulted for evaluation of a possible new stroke.

Of note, she was admitted to the stroke service in ___ for 3 episodes of amaurosis fugax in the right eye. CTA and carotid ultrasound re-demonstrated considerable atherosclerosis in the extra and intracranial vessels (<40% bilaterally) and she was started on a statin and aspirin in addition to her plavix. Her aspirin was discontinued after 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in ___.

IMAGING: CT head ___ IMPRESSION: New hypodensity in the right posterior temporal lobe since ___, concerning for subacute infarction with differentials including vasogenic edema from underlying mass, further evaluation with MRI can be obtained.

MRI head w/wo, MRA head/neck ___ IMPRESSION: 1. Subacute right posterior temporal/ occipital lobe infarct with associated hemorrhage corresponding with a right posterior cerebral artery distribution. 2. No focal vascular occlusion or aneurysm. 3. Scattered atherosclerotic vascular disease including intracranial vascular irregularity which appears more prominent when compared to prior CT exam; however, this may be on a technical basis.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on clopidogrel due to past GI bleed while on coumadin, intracranial atherosclerosis, and amaurosis fugax who presented with headache and confusion. On exam she was found to be inattentive, perseverative, and neglecting the left side with a left homonymous hemianopia. She was found to have an infarct in the right PCA distribution affecting the occipital and temporal lobes with hemorrhagic transfomation. Stroke workup demonstrated persistent intracranial atherosclerosis; her LDL was 65 on atorvastatin 80 mg. She had persistent atrial fibrillation; echocardiogram was not obtained as it would not change her management. Overall her stroke was thought to be secondary to large vessel cardioembolus from her atrial fibrillation, although artery to artery embolus could not be excluded. Given her failure of clopidogrel therapy, a plan was made to start apixaban two weeks after infarct given her hemorrhagic transformation and until that time she was continued on aspirin. She will stop aspirin once she starts apixaban. She was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy who recommended acute rehab. Although she was independent prior to presentation, she may not regain this level of independence given her left-sided field cut and neglect.

Her A1c was also elevated at 9.1% and ___ was consulted for management of her diabetes. Given her age and comorbidities, goal A1c of ___ was most appropriate. She was transitioned from glyburide to glipizide on discharge.

Her blood pressure medications were halved on admission for permissive hypertension and were gradually reintroduced to maintain SBP < 160 given hemorrhagic transformation. Her torsemide had been held on admission.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because of visual difficulties and confusion you experienced on ___. We found a moderate-sized right sided stroke that explained your symptoms. It was felt the stroke was a result of a complication of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. You were started on a medication called aspirin to thin your blood. In two weeks, your PCP should follow up with a new medication, Apixaban, to help avoid stroke recurrence. When you start this new medication, you should stop aspirin. You have been switched from glyburide to glipizide for your diabetes.

We wish you the best in your recovery. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns. 

Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team  Followup Instructions: ___
