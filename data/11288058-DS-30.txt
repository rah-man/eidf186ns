 History of Present Illness: Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with ESRD ___ ANCA positive GN on HD (MWF), sero-negative RA, moderate-severe MR and moderate TR on Echo ___, s/p multiple microvascular CNS hemorrhages, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and s/p right fistula angioplasty on ___, who presents from hemodialysis with fever, nausea, vomiting, and chills. Patient reports she had poor appetite yesterday and had chills while at hair___, but thinks it was because the room was cold. She checked her BP last night, and it was BP 116/42, which was low for her. (Per her report, she ranges higher.) Today she felt well in the morning, but during her HD session she had chills, rigors, developed nausea and vomited once. Her temperature was high, but she does not remember the actual number. She was sent to the ED from HD.  .  In the ED, initial VS T 104.8, HR 110, BP 139/58, Sat 96%. She stated that she felt better but was still mildly nauseated. Her temp fell to 102.9 after tylenol. Initially sats were to 89% on RA but on re-check was 94-95% on RA. She was placed on 2L 02 with sat 100%. CXR revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and improved vascular congestion but no signs of consolidation. Two sets of blood cultures were taken, and she was given 2.25 g Zosyn and 1 g vancomycin. Urinalysis was negative, WBC was 10.4 (baseline of ___, and other labs were at baseline. VS on transfer T 102.2, HR 88, RR 12, Sat 99-100%, BP 112/47.  .  On the floor, she states she is feeling well and has no complaints.  .  ROS:  (+)Mild HA while nauseated but now resolved.  (-)Denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea, joint pain, rashes, neck pain, visual changes, sensitivity to ligh or sound, pain over fistula site, cough, congestion or sore throat, burning on urination or change in urinary habits.

MICRO: Blood culture ___: Pan-sensitive e. coli All other blood cultures: no growth to date. Stool cultures and C. diff. negative. . STUDIES: . CXR ___: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with aortic knob calcifications redemonstrated. Previous pattern of mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests small pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is present. Dense material is noted within the splenic flexure, which appears longstanding and may represent residual barium. IMPRESSION: Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. No new areas of focal consolidation identified. . RUE GRAFT U/S ___: RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: In the region of the arteriovenous graft, there is a blind-ending sac at the anastomosis. There is a small clot within the blind ending sac which could represent hematoma in a branching vessel.  The graft is patent without intraluminal clot. Normal waveforms are demonstrated in the AV fistula. . Echocardiogram ___: Conclusions  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (the precise orifice area could not be calculated due to questionable left ventricular outflow tract dimension measurement). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, findings are similar. IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen . Abdominal CT ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Dilated common bile duct up to 2 cm with extensive pneumobilia. There is concern for an obstructing stone in the distal common bile duct.  2. No evidence for fluid collection . ERCP ___: Impression: 1. S/P sphincterotomy.  2. A severe diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 18 mm. 3. There was tortuosity in the distal CBD - this was unchanged from cholangiogram in ___. 4. Sludge and stone fragments were noted in the proximal CBD/CHD. These were removed using a balloon catheter and an extraction basket. 5. Excellent drainage of contrast and bile was noted.  

 Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ yo F with multiple medical problems including ESRD who presents with fever and rigors during HD.  .  # Fever: Patient began having fevers and rigors during HD 1 day prior to admission with temperature in the ED of 104.8. Other than mild nausea and vomiting while she was having HD, she had no localizing symptoms. CXR did not show pneumonia. The patient denied dysuria and had a clean urinalysis.  She was started empirically on cefepime and vancomycin (given after HD). Blood cultures subsequently grew out Gram negative rods. ID was consulted given unclear source of fevers and recommended double Pseudomonal coverage with meropenem/ciprofloxacin for the Gram negative rods. Ciprofloxacin was subsequently discontinued, as patient developed rash and itchiness around IV site during infusion. Cultures were subsequently finalized as pan-sensitive E. coli, and antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone. She does have history MR/TR with a significant murmur, so endocarditis was considered and TTE showed no vegetations or significant changes. We also explored her right upper extremity dialysis graft as a possible source and ultrasound showed no vegetation but possible small clot in the blind sac of the graft.  Transplant surgery was subsequently consulted to address this and believed that the patient's graft was unlikely to be the source of an E. coli bacteremia. CT abdomen was then obtained and ruled out abscesses; however, there was suggestion of a stone blocking the common bile duct. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy. During this work-up, the patient was switched to cefazolin, so that she could be given antibiotic therapy through her AV graft during her dialysis sessions. This intervention prevents her from needing a PICC line, since her nephrologist would like to avoid PICCs due to challenging access. Because of the suspicion of stone, the patient underwent ERCP. No stone was discovered, but some sludge and debris were cleared and a sphincterotomy performed. The patient has been afebrile during her entire hospitalization. Infectious Disease suggested that the patient then receive 14 more days of cefazolin therapy (Day ___ Day ___, . # ESRD: Patient had HD ___ prior to admission. She was maintained on her home ___ dialysis regimen and medications were renally dosed. Her colchicine was held. Her BUN and Cr fluctuated in ways appropriate to her dialysis schedule. .  # Diarrhea: The patient had two days of diarrhea, but the diarrhea resolved with loperamide treatment. C. diff. toxins negative. Fecal cultures negative. C. diff. PCR was also negative. .  # GERD: Continued home omeprazole.  .  # Hypertension: Well-controlled during this hospitalization. Clonidine, doxazosin, and metoprolol were provided during her stay. Amlodipine did not have to be restarted due to adequate control with the three agents above. . # Macrocytic anemia: Vitamin B12 levels pending at time of discharge. ___ be followed up as outpatient. .

 Discharge Instructions: Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for fevers and chills that you had during dialysis. We feel the source of your fevers was E. coli bacteremia, which means that you had a microorganism growing in your blood. Our transplant surgery team does not feel that your graft is responsible for the infection. You were seen by our infectious disease specialists and were started on antibiotics; they also thought it was unlikely that your graft was the cause. An ultrasound did not show any big clots in your arm or graft. Imaging of your hearts howed that there were no infections on the valves of your heart. We then obtained a CT (imaging) of your abdomen and pelvis to look for any source of infection there. No abscesses were seen, but there was concern that there might be a stone obstructing your common bile duct. Because of this concern, you underwent a procedure to examine and open up the sphincter where your biliary tree meets your intestine. That examination went well and cleaned out some sludge and debris, but no stone was found. . You never had a fever after you started antibiotics, so we think that your infection is well-controlled. We think you can go home and then receive the rest of the course of antibiotics during your hemodialysis. . START cefazolin for two weeks at your dialysis sessions.  Followup Instructions: ___
