CXR ABDOMENL: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of free air.  Bowel gas pattern is nonspecific. Scoliosis is noted.  Degenerative changes are seen within the spine, better evaluated on the CT abdomen and pelvis from two days earlier. Fixation rod is noted in the left femoral head. Better seen on the same day chest radiograph are pacer leads and additional wires. IMPRESSION: No good evidence of free air or obstruction. 

CXR: Aside from a small region of atelectasis at the left base, lungs are clear. There may be a new small left pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta is tortuous and generally large but not focally aneurysmal. No pneumothorax.  Tranvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in place, but their course is not standard and would require at least conventional views for assessment. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ s/p recent admissions for hip fx and pneumonia complicated by sepsis at ___ who presents from her rehab facility with hypotension, diarrhea, pronounced leukocytosis with left shift, c/w + C diff.

# Severe C diff, hypotension: Per ___ guidelines has severe C diff based on presence of: WBC > 15, Hypoalbuminemia (< or = 2.5 mg/dl), Serum Cr increase of 1.5 x baseline, and pan-colitis on imagine. Given ICU transfer, would be classified as severe complcated C diff. Normally, surgery consult would be appropriate for this severity of disease, but this is not within the goals of care of this patient (discussed with HCP).
