There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.   Electronically signed by ___, MD, Interpreting physician ___ ___ 14:09

 Brief Hospital Course: During the preoperative workup, an abdominal MRI was performed to evaluate the abdominal aorta for plaque/calcifications, and evaluate renal arteries for plaques/calcifications. Based on the MRI results, a future MRCP was recommended by Radiology. The MRI results per Radiology are as follows:

# Pancreatic cysts: This was found on MRI of the abdomen as part of the pre-op work-up. Diagnostic considerations include multiple side branch IPMNs versus sequela of pancreatitis.  Radiology recommended a MRCP in six months. 

# Multiple hemorrhagic cysts within the kidneys: This was found on MRI of the abdomen. This should also be evaluated by MRCP.

The ___ was brought to the operating room on ___ where he underwent aortic valve replacement. Please see ___ ___ report for further details. Overall the ___ tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Vancomycin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis given the preoperative stay of longer than 24 hours. ___ awoke neurologically intact and was weaned and extubated without difficulty. The ___ was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic or vasopressor support by POD 2. Beta blocker was initiated and the ___ was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued in a timely fashion, without complication. The ___ was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. He continued to progress and was cleared by ___ discharge to home on POD ******** All follow up appointments were advised. ****stopped ___  Medications on Admission: 1. aspirin 81 mg daily  2. lipitor 10 mg every other day  3.
