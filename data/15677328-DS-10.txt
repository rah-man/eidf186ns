Large occlusive thrombus the right main pulmonary artery extending to lobar and segmental upper and middle lobe branches. 

2. No evidence of aneurysm or dissection in the arterial structures of the head and neck. 3. 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria.  Atheromatous plaque of the proximal left cervical internal carotid arteries form a free floating thrombus, a high risk lesion. 4. High-grade stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery and irregularity of portions of the proximal right V2 segment likely secondary to atherosclerosis. 5. Atherosclerotic disease of intracranial circulation without evidence of high-grade stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm. 

CT head without contrast ___ Motion limited evaluation without acute intracranial process.

CXR ___ Subtle patchy opacity projecting over the left mid to lower lung could be due to pneumonia. Dedicated PA and lateral views would help further assess if patient able. 

ECHO ___ The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no evidence of intracardiac shunt based on agitated saline study (although suboptimal). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with focal calcification of the left coronary cusp but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, findings are similar. 

CT head without contrast ___ IMPRESSION:  1. The exam is moderately degraded by patient motion. 2. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.   CTA chest w and w/out contrast and CT abdomen ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Pulmonary emboli extending from the distal right main pulmonary artery into the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right upper, right middle, and right lower lobes. 2. Pulmonary emboli within left upper lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries. 3. No evidence of pulmonary infarction. 4. Relatively atrophic left kidney with areas of cortical thinning, possibly the sequela of prior infection. A 2.5 x 1.4 cm indeterminate lesion with rim enhancement in the upper pole of the left kidney may represent an involuting cyst.   RECOMMENDATION(S): Outpatient ultrasound evaluation of left kidney lesion.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of diabetes who presented with confusion, aphasia with receptive worse than expressive and decreased use of the right hand.  

#Neuro: His confusion, aphasia, and decreased use of R hand felt most likely to be due to ischemic stroke given the acute onset of focal neurological symptoms without other findings on CT on ___. Stroke risk factors included diabetes, with elevated blood sugars morning of admission, suggesting that he may have poor control (HbA1c found to be 12.21). Follow up CT obtained ___ obtained, without any findings of intracranial process, in context of knee replacement and penile implant with metal, precluding ability to obtain MRI. In terms of his stroke risk factors, HbA1c 12.2 and LDL 120. Atorvastatin 80 was started when patient started tolerating PO. ___, OT, and speech and swallow evaluations were all obtained. He was on falls and aspiration precautions. He did not require an EEG as he was no longer altered after Haldol and Ativan (administered in ED for agitation) wore off. CTA neck showed 40% atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal left internal carotid artery with a probable thrombus adherent to the plaque. Vascular Surgery was consulted regarding whether an intervention on the left internal carotid artery was warranted. Dr. ___, and Dr. ___ this and decided that the risks of a left carotid CEA or left carotid stenting outweighed the potential benefits. Coumadin started to prevent any emboli from the left carotid artery as well as to treat his PE. 

# PE: He was also found incidentally to have a large occlusive thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery extending to the lobar and segmental upper lobe and partially imaged middle lobe branches. He was started on heparin gtt and PTT maintained between ___ throughout hospitalization.

# ___: EKG obtained, and he was maintained on telemetry. Cardiac enzymes were negative for MI. His goal SBP was 140-180's, and hydralazine 10 mg was given q6 hour as needed for SBP >180. ECHO was obtained, which showed normal EF and no evidence of intracardiac shunt though study was suboptimal per report.   # ENDO: His HbA1c here during hospitalization was 12.2. ___ was consulted, who recommended specific inpatient regimen, and recommended that patient be discharged on Insulin with close f/u with Dr. ___. We also made an appointment for him with endocrinologist Dr. ___ at ___. 

TRANISITIONAL ISSUES: - poorly controlled HTN, DM2, and HLD - increased atorvastatin from 40 to 80mg daily - R groin hematoma in the context of femoral line (placed in the ED, not necessary or indicated as pertains to his neurological needs throughout admission) - started on Coumadin with heparin gtt bridge. Goal PTT 60-80, check PTT every 6 hours until stable, then q12h

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,   You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion and speech difficulties resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.   Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol  We are changing your medications as follows:  You will continue taking warfarin (Coumadin) to treat the clot in your lungs. Your Atorvastatin will be increased from 40mg daily to 80mg daily.  Please take your other medications as prescribed.   Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. 

 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:  - sudden partial or complete loss of vision  - sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  - sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you  - sudden weakness of one side of the body  - sudden drooping of one side of the face  - sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body   Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team  Followup Instructions: ___
