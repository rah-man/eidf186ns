#Bilateral acute on chronic SDHs The patient was admitted to Neurosurgery on ___ and scheduled for surgery on ___. The patient was taken to the OR on ___ for bilateral mini craniotomies for evacuation of the bilateral acute on chronic SDHs. The operation was uncomplicated. Please see OMR for further intraoperative details. The patient was extubated in the OR and recovered in the PACU. He was transferred to the step down unit postoperatively for close neurologic monitoring. The patient remained neurologically stable. Repeat imaging on ___ showed improvement in the bilateral SDHs but also showed a new cerebellar IPH. Despite this, the patient's neurologic exam remained unchanged. Two subdural drains were kept in place postoperatively, which were subsequently removed on ___ without incident. Post pull imaging was stable. Patient continued to remain stable. 

#Right cerebellar IPH The patient was found to have a new right cerebellar IPH on repeat imaging on ___. This was thought to be unrelated to the bilateral SDHs. Stroke neurology was consulted and recommended labs including A1c, lipids, TSH which were all normal. It was recommended to hold sq heparin. A CTA of the head and neck was ordered to evaluate for underlying cerebrovascular lesion and showed stable hematoma with surrounding edema and stable post-surgical changes, focal stenosis of the bilateral P2 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally with the remainder of the vessels normal. An MRI of the head with and without contrast was also ordered to evaluate for underling mass and showed no evidence of cavernous/venous sinus thrombosis, and a new punctate acute infarct in the left frontal lobe, punctate chronic infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere and no concern for underlying lesion. Patient complained of worsening dizziness and increased lethargy on ___ although his exam remained stable. His SBP was 170's during an episode of incontinence prior to his scheduled AM antihypertensives. His BP came down after ADLs and scheduled morning meds to SBP 120s. A CT head without contrast showed stable R cerebellar hematoma with mild edema and stable right tentorial and parafalcine subdural hematomas. Stroke neurology recommended discontinuation of SQH in the setting of new hemorrhage and recommended a repeat CTH on ___. Repeat CTH revealed stable infarct and cerebellar hemorrhage and recommended restarting SQH. Patient also underwent a TTE on ___ for official stroke workup which revealed EF of 62%, no structural source of embolism, normal left wall thickness and function, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary aortic systolic hypertension. 

#Right knee pain The patient complained of right knee pain while admitted. Given his history of falls, x-rays of the knees were ordered and were negative for acute fracture.

#Constipation Patient had not moved his bowels for 6 days post-operatively. He was ordered for a suppository on ___ with good effect and had a BM later in the evening. Patient continued to be monitored closely and remained on steady bowel regimen. 

#Urinary retention Patient has had continued urinary retention requiring intermittent straight cath during admission. Please continue straight cath q 6 hrs and prn. Continue Flomax 0.8mg QHS. See Urology in clinic in ___ weeks if not improved.

#Right thyroid nodule The patient had an incidental finding of a right thyroid nodule while admitted. He reports he's had partial resection in the past. He was advised to follow-up with his PCP after discharge for an ultrasound to further evaluate the finding. 

#Disposition ___ and OT were consulted and recommended acute rehab. Patient was discharged to rehab on ___. Patient scheduled for follow up with Dr. ___ in 8 weeks with a repeat MRI.
