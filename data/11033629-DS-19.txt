Discharge labs: ___ WBC-7.9 Hgb-11.7* Hct-33.6* Plt ___ . Micro: ___ Urine cultur: no growth ___ Blood cultures: pending*** .  CXR ___: The cardiac size is normal. The mediastinal contours demonstrate a markedly tortuous aorta with calcified atherosclerotic disease at the knob and descending aorta. Clips in the right hilar region are most consistent with the patient's known history of prior partial resection and deformity of the right posterior fifth rib is also consistent with prior thoracotomy. The lungs are clear. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again is noted an unchanged wedge-deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, unchanged since ___. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. . CT ___ Abd/Pelv: 1. Distended hyperemic gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid concerning for acute cholecystitis; right upper quadrant ultrasound is recommended. 2. Dense structure in the region of the gallbladder neck/neighboring duodenum may represent an impacted gallstone, varix, or enhancing soft tissue nodule. Further attention will be paid on ensuing ultrasound. . RUQ ultrasound ___: Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening and small amount of pericholecystic fluid. Although no sonographic ___ sign, findings raise concern for early acute cholecystitis in the appropriate clinical setting. . CT head ___: No acute intracranial process; chronic small vessel ischemic disease and atrophic changes. .  EKG ___: sinus tachycardia to 110, left axis wnl, flattened T-waves II, III, AVF, TWI V4-V6 with minimal ST elevations < 0.5mm V5-V6, low QRS voltage. ST-T changes are new compared to ___ tracing. . Echocardiography ___: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall and distal anterolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = ___. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Technically suboptimal study. Normal cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD. Increased PCWP. Mild aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar, and better defined on the current study.  Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with PMH of CVA, HTN, COPD and mild dementia who presents with AMS one day after transient complaints of n/v/abdominal pain and was found to have an NSTEMI. . # NSTEMI: Mrs ___ was found to have an inferior-lateral NSTEMI by EKG changes and positive enzymes (see pertinent results above). She was thought to have suffered the MI a day prior to her presentation; her symptoms of epigastric pain and vomiting were probably angina aquivalent. This was supported by the finding on presentation of later stage enzyme elevations including LDH and AST. The minimal ST elevation in V5-V6 were not thought to not qualifty this as an STEMI. The patient was stable hemodynamically and well saturated on room air throughout her admission w/o overt signs of heart failure, but her tachycardia and increased JVD may have hinted to some hemodynamic effects of her MI. Echocardiography showed normal cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction (EF 35%) suggestive of multivessel CAD; also increased PCWP, mild aortic and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Cardiology was consulted and recommended conservative managment, as the acute ischemic event was thought to have resolved prior to presentation rendering reperfusional intervention without significant short term or long term benefit. Mrs. ___ was started on Aspirin and Plavix in place of Aggrenox-aspirin combination, and she was treated with 48 hours of IV heparin. She was continued on her ACE-I. A beta blocker was started, and her statin was increased to high-dose.  Her tachycardia resolved and she continued to be asymptomatic and clinically stable throughout her course. . # Low-normal blood pressure: Patient reports low-normal BP at baseline, and her SBPs were stably in the ___ with the addition of the beta blocker; she was not orthostatic. Her blood pressure should continued to be monitored with adjustment of antihypertensives as needed. . # Cholelithiasis: Upon presentation US + CT of the abdomen demonstarted cholelithiasis as well as raised the specter of a possible developing acute cholecystitis given leukocytosis. She recieved 1 dose of Unasyn in the ED but this was discontinued on the floor. She remained afebrile and asymptomatic; her abdominal exams were benign throughout her hospital course, and her LFTs normalized. Could consider surgical evaluation in the outpatient setting for prophylactic cholecystectomy. . # Leukocystosis: Mrs ___ was afebrile at and throughout presentation and had a significant leukocytosis which later resolved and was thought to be secondary to her MI. Micro culture has been negative to date. . # COPD: Mrs. ___ has baseline COPD and developed some wheezing during this admission. This may have been related to starting BB therapy. She has baseline tachypnea, her respiratory rates were in the ___ on admission and came down to the low ___ on discharge. She had no cough or fever and responded well to nebulized bronchodialators. . # Anemia: Hct downtrended from 45.8 to 33.6 but remained stable in the low ___ on discharge. The initial levels may have been falsely elevated due to hemoconcentration in the setting of dehydration as she also had a mild rise in Cr from 0.9 to 1.2. Her stool guaiacs were negative and she had no other overt bleeding. Her Hct should continue to be repeated post-discharge and further outpatient work-up done for anemia as needed. . # Acute renal failure: Creatinine uptrended from 0.9 on presentation to 1.2. Her FeNa and FEUrea suggested a prerenal etiology and Cr normalized with encouragement of po fluid intake.  . # Pending Labs: ___ Blood cultures x 2 ****  Medications on Admission: -home 02 2L at night and 4L with ambulation -Nortriptyline 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime).  -Lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  -Simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  -Mirtazapine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime).  -Pregabalin (Lyrica) 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).  -Folic Acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  -Dipyridamole-Aspirin (Aggrenox) ___ mg Cap, Multiphasic Release 12 hr Sig: One (1) Cap PO BID (2 times a day).   -DuoNeb 0.5-2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.  -Pyridoxine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY.  -Ranitidine HCl 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of abdominal pain and vomiting the day prior to your admission. You were found to have had a myocardial infarction or heart attack which is what happens when the blood flow to part of your heart muscle is obstructed for a period of time by a blood clot causing damage to heart muscle cells. You were treated with medication to allow the blood clot to dissipate and improve the condition of your heart muscle. You do have some decrease in your heart pump function, and this will need to be followed up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. . The following changes were made to your medications: . 1. Aggrenox-aspirin capsule was discontinued. 2. Aspirin 325mg tablet was started. Take 1 tablet once daily to reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke. 3. Plavix 75mg tablet was started. You should take one tablet once daily to reduce the risk of heart attack. 4. Simvastatin 40mg tablet was changed to Simvastatin 80mg tablet, you should take 1 tablet once daily to control your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart attack. 5. Rantidine 300mg tablet was changed to Ranitidine 150mg tablet which is a dose better ___ to your renal functions. Take one tablet twice daily to lower acidity in your stomach.
