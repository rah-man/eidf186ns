 ___ of Present Illness: ___ woman who underwent L4-L5 laminectomy fusion in ___ for treatment of spondylolisthesis. She did well for many years, but developed adjacent segment disease at L3-L4. For treatment of that, I have provided her with a decompression and fusion on ___. Following surgery, she did very well, with reduction in her pain, but she did have a fall in which she sustained endplate fracture at L3, involving her instrumentation. Unfortunately, she developed a nonunion subsequent to that, with considerable osteolysis around this L3 screws where she did have a fracture. When I last saw her, her new MRI and her new CT scan demonstrated significant instability, established nonunion at L3-L4 and I did inform her that surgical treatment for this could be considered, particularly if her symptoms continue to be bothersome over time.
