 Pertinent Results: MRI/MRA: 1. Scattered foci of subacute infarction in the right frontal lobe in the territory of right anterior cerebral artery. Partial occlusion of the right anterior cerebral artery seen on the MRA images. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.   2. Several foci of chronic ischemic change seen in both cerebral hemispheres.   3. Atherosclerosis seen throughout the vasculature of the head and neck. 

Renal US: No hydronephrosis or stone. Small right mid pole renal cyst, likely containing milk of calcium. 

Lipid Panel: Chol 175, ___ 69,HDL 74, chol/HD 2.4, LDL calc 87 ALT 32, AST 40, ALP 61

EEG: Pending TEE: result pending 

ECHO:The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.   Brief Hospital Course: Upon admission Ms. ___ had an EEG to wean Zonisamide. Zonisamide stopped. Vimpat increased to 100 mg BID and EEG stopped. At that point a full stroke workup was performed to find etiology of left foot weakness. MRI confirms stroke in ACA territory. Also R ACA MRA showed poor flow. Statin started and Aspirin was continued. A TEE was performed to look for cardioembolic sources of the CVA. Telemetry was continued throughout the patients hospital stay. Lipid panel and blood work appeared unremarkable. ___ has continued to work with Ms. ___ and she was fitted for a left leg brace. It was found that patient will need to be discharged to a rehab facility. ECHO was done to assess cardiac status. Findings appeared to be age related and do not contribute to clinical picture. Patient noted to begin to gain movement and increased strength in her left lower extremity upon discharge. Sent to rehab on ___.
