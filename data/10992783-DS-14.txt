As per review ___ records, he presented on ___ and had described intermittent nausea/vomiting/fever, so had UA which was negative, then had CT A/P which revealed new bladder tumor. CBC was notable for normal WBC but 22% bands. Blood cultures were drawn and are NGTD. CXR without infiltrate.

Today, pt explained that he initially had vomiting which caused him to seek care at ___. He noted that there they could not identify a cause of his symptoms, and wanted to keep him for observation but he noted that he was eager to go home so pressured them to discharge him. He was aware that they found a mass on the bladder for which he was supposed to followup with an oncologist

He noted that since going home his vomiting resolved, and he had been a little constipated but fevers were ongoing. He noted that today he developed swelling of b/l cheeks which was tender to touch which caused him concern. He noted that he shaves with a razor but did not ___ himself in the area.

ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES ===================== #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: #Multifocal PNA During admission patient developed next oxygen requirement and persistent fever. CXR was initially concerning for volume overload and he was treated with IV Lasix as below. CT Chest then demonstrated bilateral multifocal bacterial PNA and antibiotics were continued. He received 5 days Azithromycin and 5 days concurrent Vancomycin/Cefepime/Flagyl before transitioning to Cefepime monotherpay. His oxygen improved and he was weaned from supplemental o2. Viral and fungal work up was negative (negative Influenza, RVP antigen and PCR panel, urine legionella, strep pneumo, monospot, ___, galactomannan). He was transitioned to PO Levofloxacin to complete a total 14 day course (on ___ for pneumonia after discussion with ___ attending. 

# HFp/rEF. In the setting of hypoxia and CXR demonstrating volume overload, TTE was performed which demonstrated new apical hypokinesis, EF 47%. Cardiology was consulted given newly depressed EF. Upon ___ the TTE and overall clinical improvement, cardiology did not feel that additional work up was necessary to evaluate for CHF. Mild depression in EF was likely exacerbated in the setting of iatrogenic volume overload, acute illness, and poorly controlled HTN. he was initially treated with IV Lasix and transitioned to PO Lasix 20mg daily for volume management. Home ___ was continued. Weight on the day of discharge was 98.6kg 217.37lbs. He will have PCP follow up and with outpatient cardiologist as needed. 

# Word finding difficulty: Patient had a transient episode on ___ associated with increased limb motor activity in mild tic like fashion and work finding difficulty without anomia. No focal deficits were noted. Neurology was consulted and CODE STROKE was called. NCHCT, CTA and MRI brain was unremarkable. Spot EEG monitoring was negative for seizure activity. mental status improved. Episode was not thought to represent acute ischemic/embolic stroke event or seizure and he was monitored without further episodes during admission. 

# Facial Swelling # Hx of sweets syndrome Patient initially presented with bilateral facial swelling. CTA Neck in the ___ demonstrated bilateral platysmal swelling consistent with cellulitis. He was started on antibiotics for fevers, possible SSTI in the setting of immunosuppression. There was no evidence of significant skin erythema. Bilateral cheek swelling improved over time without specific intervention.

# Rash on back. Developed during inpatient. Evaluated by Dermatology, morphology not consistent with specific etiology. Reassuring examination with skin findings thought to be exacerbated by moisture and positioning in hospital bed. Advised to keep area clean and dry and to monitor for any progression of symptoms. 

# HTN. Continued home lisinopril/amlodipine after resolution of ___. 

# AML (on decitabine s/p C19). Last decitabine given end of ___. Continued home acyclovir ppx. CBC w/ diff daily

# Bladder Mass. Identified on CT A/P on ___ at ___. Urology was consulted, reviewed imaging and determined no acute inpatient management was needed. He will have follow up in clinic on ___ for outpatient cystoscopy for further management.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization. Briefly, you were admitted with neck swelling and fevers. Your neck swelling improved. Your oxygen level dropped and you were started on antibiotics. A CT scan of your chest showed a bacterial pneumonia. You were treated with IV antibiotics and transitioned to oral antibiotics at the time of discharge. Your breathing improved and you no longer needed oxygen. You were seen by the Dermatologists for the skin rash on your back and should try to keep your back dry. 

Please continue to take your antibiotics as prescribed and follow up with your providers as listed. 

We wish you the best,
