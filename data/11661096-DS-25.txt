 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,   It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ ___! 

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  ==========================  - You came to the emergency room because of chest pain. You had an abnormal EKG and abnormal cardiac blood tests, indicating a heart attack (NSTEMI) so you were admitted to the hospital for further care.   WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  ==============================  - You had a cardiac catheterization test that showed no apparent coronary artery disease. Your heart attack was probably caused by ruptured plaque in a coronary artery. - You had a heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) that reassuringly showed no change in heart function. 

 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  ================================  - Instructions regarding care of the access site (your right wrist)are included with your discharge information.  - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below).  - Follow up with your doctors as listed below.  - It is strongly recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab program in the near future. A referral form was provided to you that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program. 

 It was a pleasure participating in your care. If you have any urgent questions that are related to your recovery from your hospitalization or are experiencing any symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at ___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse practitioner.   -Your ___ Care Team   Followup Instructions: ___
