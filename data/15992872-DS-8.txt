R KNEE X RAY - Images reviewed by author - Prothesis in place w/o fracture - Joint effusion . OSH RLE US: No DVT in common femoral, femoral, poplieal and posterior tibial veins. The peronial veins could not be visualized secondary to vessel depth. 

Right thigh ultrasound: ___ 1. 1.3 x 2.0 cm small area of mixed echogenicity fluid in the right anterior thigh near the surgical scar, is of indeterminate significance. The relationship of this fluid to the joint space about the prosthesis is not well depicted.  2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema involving distal thigh and calf. In this patient with overlying cutaneous erythema, cellulitis is suspected.

Arterial studies ___ IMPRESSION: Unremarkable arterial study at rest. No evidence of significant peripheral vascular disease, either inflow or outflow.

CT lower extremities: IMPRESSION: 1. No defined or drainable fluid collections to suggest abscess. No specific CT findings to suggest osteomyelitis. 2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema involving both lower extremities, however more so on the right side, compatible with clinical history of right lower extremity cellulitis.  ___ IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ with a history of RA (recently on prednisone and methotrexate -no longer on either), CAD s/p PCI, Afib (was on coumadin), CKD, and Obesity, a history of vertebral osteomyelitis and history of psoas abscess, along with recurrent RLE cellulitis admitted for erythema of RLE along with fever, concerning for cellulitis

Her right leg cellulitis was managed closely with infectious disease service. Initial concern was for potentially underlying abscess. After speaking with radiology on optimal study, obtained a concern of phlegmon, but location not consistent with pain/redness. Underwent a CT scan that did not reveal an abscess. The pt was initiated on ___, later narrowed to Vanco, but then developed ___ (with positive urine eos suggestive of AIN) and was then switched to Ceftaroline. The patients legs were elevated and her symptoms improved. The patient had significant improvement on Ceftaroline and was discharged off antibiotics. ___ was negative for DVT. 

As noted above, the patient developed acute renal failure while on antibiotics with urine eosinophils suggestive of AIN. Creatinine peaked at 2.5. Her creatinine returned to her baseline of 1.9-2.1 on discharge.
