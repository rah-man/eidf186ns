On ___, the patient underwent pylorus sparing radical pancreatoduodenectomy. Secondary to large blood loss and pressors requirement, patient was transferred in ICU post operatively, intubated. He received 2 units of pRBC intraoperatively. On POD 1 patient was extubated, he received 10 mg of vitamin K for increased INR. On POD 2 patient was transferred to the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable. Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids. NGT was removed on POD 1 and G-tube was capped on POD 4. Patient was started on sips of clears and tubefeed on POD 5. Tubefeed (Jevity 1.5) was advanced to goal and started to cycle on POD 7. Patient developed diarrhea and bloating on Jevity and tubefeed formula was changed to home formula, Promote with fiber, which was well tolerated. Diet was advanced to regular on POD 8, patient demonstrated inadequate PO intake and will required tubefeed after discharge. JP's output was tested for amylase twice on POD 3 and POD 6, JP amylase from JP 2 was high concerning for pancreatic leak. JP 1 was discontinued prior discharge, JP 2 was left in place after discharge. Patient's PTBD catheter was capped on POD 7, LFTs were within normal limits after capping PTBD. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Patient creatinine bumped to 2.0 from 1.0 on POD 14 with adequate response to fluids. Last creatinine checked on ___ was 1.5 trending down from 1.8. ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection. WBC was elevated post op, thought to be secondary to pancreatic leak. WBC returned to normal as output from JP 2 decreased. Wound was evaluated daily and small serosanguinous drainage was noticed on POD 5. Dry dressing was applied daily on this area, no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed. Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. Hematology: Intraoperatively patient received 2 units of RBC. Post op patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required. Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible. He was started on Lovenox prior discharge for 30 day as post operative DVT prophylaxis.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating sips with meds and tubefeed at goal, rate 115ml/hr, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
