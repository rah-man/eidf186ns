Today ___, the patient went to outpatient pre-op appointment for planned LLE cyst removal on ___. During triage, patient was found to have concerning EKG changes (unavailable for viewing), and subsequently sent into ___ ED for further evaluation. 

In ED, In the ED, initial VS were 96.7 66 113/58 18 96%. Labs were notable for unremarkable CBC, unremarkable LFTs, Chem-7 with K 5.6 and BUN/Cr 98/3.9, Coags with INR 3.0, proBNP 3050, lactate 0.9, and ABG 7.___. CXR showed cardiomegaly, AICD leads in RA and RV, no acute intrathoracic process, calcified left ventricular aneurysm. Bedside ECHO notable for minimal pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology, normal RV function, poor LV function. While in the ED, the patient was found to be hypotensive to sBP 70-80s, for which RIJ line was placed, patient was started on norepinephrine and administered fluid boluses (2x 250cc NS) with improvement in SBP to 120s.

IMAGING ======= EKG ___ Regular wide complex rhythm without convincing organzied P wave activity. Right axis deviation with left bundle-branch block morphology and the morphological pattern of the QRS complex suggests accelerated idioventricular rhythm with secondary repolarization abnormalities. Prolonged Q-T interval. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ ventricular arrhythmia has replaced atrial pacing with P-R interval prolongation. Current QRS configuration is unlike any of the prior QRS morphologies seen with ventricular pacing or native left bundle-branch block. ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL and V2 most likely secondary to the conduction abnormality. An ongoing ischemic process with ventricular arrhythmia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is suggested. Wide complex with a downward frontal plane axis argues against ventricular pacing as an explanation.   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 82 92 ___ 0 0 0 

ECHO ___ Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = ___ %). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison. 

CXR ___ IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with no acute intrathoracic process.  Stable calcified rounded density in the left lung base is unchanged and relates to a calcified left ventricular aneurysm.  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ with sCHF (EF 25% in ___ s/p ICD placement, CAD with twin LAD system on ___ cath, and AFib on coumadin who presented for abnormal EKG findings found to be hypotensive. 

# Hypotension: Initial differential diagnosis included hypovolemia, infection/sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmia with decreased diastolic filling time and decreased forward flow. Most likely etiology is hypovolemia given recent diarrhea and ongoing diuretic use. Infectious work-up negative and patient without fevers or other signs/sx of infection. No signs of decompensated heart failure on radiology or exam. She initially required levophed, which was weaned off with the help of small volume fluid boluses. Orthostatics were negative after levophed weaned. 

# CHF: EF of 25% in ___ s/p AICD. Home regimen is spironolactone 25mg daily, torsemide 10mg daily, metoprolol 25XL at home. proBNP was elevated on admission, though she appeared euvolemic on exam. Home spironolactone, torsemide, and metoprolol were initially held in the setting of hypotension. Torsemide and metoprolol were restarted when her blood pressures were stable and within normal limits. Spironolactone was held given her hyperkalemia.

# Acute on Chronic kidney disease: Patient presented with a Creatinine of 3.9, baseline per OMR 0.8-1.3. Likely pre-renal in etiology given BUN/Cr and recent history of diarrhea with continued diuretic use. FeUrea (recent diuretic use) <35% c/w pre-renal etiology. Improved to ___ s/p fluid boluses, and on discharge was 1.8.

# Hyperkalemia: Potassium on admission was 5.6 and increased to peak of 5.9 without any EKG changes. Most likely ___ ___ in the setting of spironolactone and ace-inhibitor. Spironolactone and lisinopril were initially held and hyperkalemia was treated with kayexylate. K on discharge was 4.5 and spironolactone was held. 

# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with CHADS2 score of 3, currently on metoprolol and warfarin as an outpatient. INR supratherapeutic to 3.7 on admission. Warfarin restarted at 1 mg when INR 3.1. Metoprolol restarted when blood pressures stabilized as above. 

# Diarrhea: Patient endorsed diarrhea 5 days prior to admission that responded to immodium which then recurred 3 days PTA but resolved on the day prior to admission. Likely a large contributing factor to the patient's hypotension. At its worst, the patient had ___ loose but not watery stools. She denied any dark stools or BRBPR but has had some associated lightheadedness. She had no further episodes of diarrhea during her hospitalization.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued with home Atorvastastin 10 mg

# Hypothyroidism: Continued with home Levothyroxine 75 mcg 

# GERD: Continued with home Ranitidine 150 mg BID

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the CCU for close monitoring because your blood pressure was found to be very low. This was likely due to several episodes of diarrhea you had in the days leading up to your hospitalization. Your blood pressure increased to a normal range with fluids. After you had the fluids, you were found to have swelling in your feet and ankles. Additional torsemide was given to remove the extra fluid. You will need to weigh yourself every day without fail in the morning before breakfast. Call Dr. ___ your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. Your weight at discharge is 142 pounds and your goal weight is 135 pounds. 

 Followup Instructions: ___
