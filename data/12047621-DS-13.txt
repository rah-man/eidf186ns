On admission had CE neg X2 and ECG findings of lateral T-wave inversion and flattening with no prior ECG for comparison but no dynamic changes on repeated tracing during this admission. He had no current pain and no other history of angina since his cath ___ years ago. The patient was on Plavix but reported that aspirin was discontinued by his pulmonologist one month prior due to an asthma flair. After discussion by telephone with his PCP and ___ cardiologist we restarted him on Aspirin 81mg daily. Patient does not have history of Aspirin Sensitive Asthma and has compelling indication for aspirin in the setting of CAD and prior stenting. He will be seen by his cardiologist next week for further assessment and likely outpatient stress testing. Plavix, lisinopril, and metoprolol were continued. . # Left Shoulder pain: Shoulder radiography demonstrated chronic degenerative changes with osteophytes. Physical exam was notable for pain on active > passive flexion and weak external rotation suggestive of possible inpingment or tear of the external rotators in the setting of chronic steroid therapy. Pain control with ice and acetaminophen as well as ___ physiotherapy are advised. ___ orthopedic follow-up was arranged. . # ecchymosis: No thrombocytopenia, normal coags. Denied history of trauma or abuse. No history of connective tissue disease. This is likely due to connective tissue changes secondary to chronic steroid therapy.  . # Feet erythema and desquamation: Clinical appearance is suggestive of tinea pedis. Discharged with Topical Miconazole. . # Asthma: Patient was on chronic prednisone at 5mg daily which was increased to 20mg daily 1 month prior after OSH admission for asthma flare. Seems to be well controlled currently, as asymptomatic and auscultation unremarkable except for some basilar crackles which correspond to atelectasis seen on CXR. INH symbicort was continued and Prednisone decreased to 15mg daily. Continued steroid taper is advised.   . # HTN: Patient reported higher than base-line BPs over the past two weeks. SBP's during this admission were in the 150's. This is likely ___ to recently increased steroid dose. Steroid taper was started and metoprolol + lisinopril continued. . # possible Aortic Stenosis: patient has physical exam findings as above suggestive of AS. Echo report of ___ was obtained which mentions concentric LVH with anterior hypokinesis and LVEF = 50%. Unfortunately no aortic indices are reported. He does not have chronic anginal symptoms except for recent episode as above. He does not report Hx of syncope or heart failure symptoms. Repeated Echocardiography may be considered in the ___ setting. . # PVD: stable per symptoms. Cilostazol continued. . # Chronic steroid therapy: as mentioned above patient is on chronic steroids for asthma with recent dose increase. He has a number of complaints and findings including ecchymosis, possible rotator cuff tear, uncontrolled HTN and cutaneous fungal infection which may, at least partially, be attributed to chronic steroid therapy. We started dose tapering and this should be continued in the outpatient setting. Would also consider bone density scan and Vit-D+Calcium supplementation.
