ACTIVE ISSUES: =================== # HYPONATREMIA: Patient presented to her PCP and found to have hyponatremia in the setting of increased free water intake around a ___ injection. There was no evidence for pseudohyponatremia. The patient was symptomatic manifested as nausea, but no neurologic deficits. Initially, it was difficult to distinguish between SIADH vs. hypovolemic hyponatremia given that she was on diuretics at the time of presentation. Renal was consulted. A diagnosis of SIADH was her serum Osm < urine osm and she appeared to be euvolemic on exam as well as her urine Na of 51. TSH and am cortisol were normal and there were no new medications started that are associated with SIADH. She was fluid restricted and her Na remained stable at 120. If hypovolemic hypnonatremia would have expected her Una to be <20. A FeUrea of 41% argues against hypovolemic cause, but a FeNa of 0.45% does support hypovolemic cause. She was then given a 1L NS challenge and her free water restriction was discontinued and her sodium improved to a discharge sodium of 128. Her diuretics were held and she was discharged on diltiazem and losartan for blood pressure control.  # Low grade temp: She presented with a temp of 100.0F. UA was unremarkable and Blood cultures were pending at the time of discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES: ================== # HTN: She was continued on her home does of losartan and diltiazem. Her blood pressures were well controlled during the hospitalization with systolics mostly in the 110s. Her HCTZ/spironolactone were held at the time of discharge. .

# GERD: She was continued on a pantoprazole (as esomeprazole was nonformulary), and reglan. 

# Anxiety: She was continued on xanaxx
