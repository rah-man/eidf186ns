Echocardiogram ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.

He was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (see op note for full details). He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on the same postoperative day. He was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and he was started on lasix to be diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complications. On the telemetry floor, he went into rapid atrial fibrillation. He was given amiodarone boluses and beta-blocker was titrated to effect. BUN/Creatinine remained elevated post-operatively, but stable in the range of ___ to 2.1. All nephortoxic medications were removed from the list of medications. His BUN/Creatinine remained at 60/2 for 3 days at the time of discharge and he continued to have adequate urine output. His left lower extremity ___ incision had mild erythema with no drainage, he was started on renal dose of keflex for 7 days. He was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 7, he was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged ___ in ___ in a good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
