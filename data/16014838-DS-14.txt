RELEVANT MICRO: =============== ___ blood cultures - negative ___ blood cultures - negative

RELEVANT IMAGING/STUDIES: ========================== ___ CTA AP 1. High-grade small-bowel obstruct in the distal ileum with relative ___ of a large segment of dilated loops of small bowel, and interval development of moderate ascites, concerning for necrotic bowel. No pneumatosis or portal venous gas. 2. Known rectal cancer with hepatic metastases are better seen on recent MRI exams. 

___ TTE The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrial pressure could not be estimated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 61 % (normal 54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There is moderate [2+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality, no parasternal short axis views, unable to visualize AoV in short axis. Probably at least moderate AS (based on calculated valve area and indexed valve area) with at least moderate aortic regurgitation however aortic valve not well visualized. Gradients elevated in setting of AR. Mildly dilated aortic root. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mild LVH with normal LV systolic function. Compared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of ___ PASP is now higher.

___ CXR Lungs are low volume with bibasilar atelectasis. Pulmonary edema has improved. Right IJ line is unchanged. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip projects to the SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Small bilateral effusions left greater than right are also unchanged. No pneumothorax. 

___ ABDOMINAL XR Worsening distension and dilatation of small bowel.  Differential includes an early presentation of obstruction versus ileus. 

___ CT ABD PELVIS WITH CONTRAST 1. Herniation of stent through the ileostomy . 2. No evidence of bowel obstruction. Air-fluid levels within the nondistended small bowel is likely related to ileus. 

___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST Several right upper lobe small ground-glass nodules are likely infectious in origin. They could explain the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The pre-existing bilateral subpleural micro nodules are all stable.  No lymphadenopathy. New right pectoral Port-A-Cath. 

 Brief Hospital Course: FICU COURSE: ============ Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o with a history of biscupid AV w/ AS HTN, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer who presented as a transfer from an OSH. He was admitted to the FICU for Afib w/ RVR to the 150's with hypotension, and underwent small bowel resection with open ostomy on ___. He required IV diltiazem and metoprolol for a fib with RVR, but converted to NSR while in the ICU. He was treated for septic shock with vanc, cefepime, flagyl, and micafungin per Colorectal Surgery recs until ___. He was weaned off of levophed and extubated on ___. He required frequent free water infusions due to hypernatremia, and was started on TPN ___. He was called out of the ICU on ___ to the Colorectal Surgery service.

Floor course ============

After transfer to the floor, the patient's stay has primarily been focused on slowing output from his ileostomy. patient has receiving increasing doses and frequency of immodium, octreotide, psylium wafers, opium tincture. On ___ a stent was placed in attempt to connect the two barrels of the ileostomy. Urology was also contacted at this time due to patients increased urinary urgency. The patient was switched to home doxazosin which appeared to help alleviate urinary problems to a manageable degree. The patient vomited on ___ and was made NPO and NGT placed. The stent was removed from the double barrel ileostomy, which was found to be collapsed in the distal barrel. on ___ the NGT was removed and patient was allowed regular low fiber food and PO medications, which was tolerated well. A PICC line was placed on ___ for continued TPN use, and CVL was removed. On ___ a red rubber tube was placed proximal stoma to collect stool output, which was to be strained and reefed through the distal barrel to "refeed" and keep up with his high output ileostomy. The red rubber tube was placed with another collecting tube to feed the distal colon ___. The patient was managed and stabilized on the floor and was then transferred to the OMED service.

On the OMED service, the patient was given his chemotherapy with FOLFOX on ___. His refeeding circuit placed by colorectal surgery was held in the setting of chemotherapy and was not restarted. His next planned chemotherapy cycle is ___. He tolerated chemotherapy well and was stable on the OMED service without complications. His ostomy output slowed and he tolerated PO intake and TPN. With coordination among his oncologist and surgeon, plan was made to discharge patient to home prior to next planned chemotherapy with a plan for eventual surgery to reanastamose his bowels at a later date. Patient was provided with filgrastim, octreotide and opium tincture on discharge for management of his chemotherapy induced neutropenia and ostomy output. He received teaching regarding ostomy care as well as TPN prior to discharge. He has followup appointments with his hematologist/oncologist and surgeon.
