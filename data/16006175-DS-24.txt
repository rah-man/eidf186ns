IMAGING/STUDIES ====================== CXR ___ IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Persistent cardiomegaly. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ w/ PMH HFrEF (EF 25%) ___ CRT on ___, severe AS ___ TAVR (___), persistent AFib seen at device clinic on ___ found to be volume overloaded, hypoxemic with poorly-controlled Afib, and AMS/somnolence. Patient was recently discharged from ___ on ___ to short term rehab facility. Upon admission, patient was diuresed with Lasix 60mg IV boluses as needed. While on tele, he was noted to have frequent HR in 100s with bursts up to 150s due to poor rate control of his AFib despite metoprolol XL, digoxin for rate control meds. He was taken for an AVJ ablation on ___.

During the admission, patient was also found to be intermittently somnolent with hypotension (SBPs ___. Patient was occasionally arousable to voice during these episodes and answered questions appropriately. CT head was negative, and episodes resolved on their own. Metoprolol succinate dose was decreased to 25mg QD and home torsemide was held. Torsemide was restarted at discharge at lower dose (10mg QD).

 # CORONARIES: -- # PUMP: EF 25% (___) # RHYTHM: afib, V-paced  

# Afib w/ intermittent periods of RVR to 150s: INR therapeutic on admission. Telemetry with Afib being conducted via A-sensed BiV-paced device up to as high a rate as ~150 for brief periods. Pacemaker interrogation on ___ prior to admission is consistent with this, showing >50% of time (approximately) the patient has HR >100. Due to intact native AV node (BiV paced for CRT), decreasing the URL of the device will not improve this problem since he will simply then conduct at these high rates but in a dyssynchronous manner. Patient was continued on home warfarin dosing for anticoagulation. For rate control, patient was taken for AVJ ablation on ___ without complication. Pacemaker rate was set at 80bmp. 

His metoprolol XL dose was decreased to 25mg QD and digoxin was discontinued since patient had little apparent benefit from initiation of digoxin at previous admission

# Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple admissions for decompensated systolic heart failure. He appeared volume overload with concern for cool extremities at the device clinic with moderate bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray on admssion. Of note, he was 1kg below his discharge weight from his recent admission. Upon arrival to the floor, he was felt to be warm and wet without evidence of cardiogenic shock. It was felt that his poorly controlled AFib was the precipitant for his decompensated heart failure. For preload, patient was diuresed with Lasix 60mg IV boluses as needed. For afterload, he was continued on lisinopril 5mg daily. For neurohumoral blockade, metoprolol succinate was decreased to 100mg QD from 25mg BID due to fatigue, altered mental status and hypotension. Patient was also continued on home spironolactone. Home torsemide was held given hypotension and restarted at a lower dose (10mg QD) at discharge.  # Lethargy / AMS: Patient was intermittently lethargic during this admission, however this was largely unchanged from his previous hospitalization. His mental status was felt to be due to symptomatic intermittent RVR and/or poor cardiac output (i.e. inadequate rate control) leading to poor perfusion. DDx included toxic metabolic encephalopathy, but other than dirty UA, no signs/sx infection. Urine cultures negative. No recent med changes other than increase in torsemide. No SOB or increased work of breathing despite hypoxemia (for which patient was at baseline O2 requirement). Patient was felt to be unlikely retaining CO2. Additional episode occured after AVJ ablation, and workup including head CT was negative at the time. Possibly episodes were due to delirium. The episodes were self-limited and the patient returned to AAOx3 baseline mental status. Quick onset/offset of episodes was odd, but it is possible that these episodes were secondary to delirium. Metoprolol succinate dose was cut and torsemide was held as described above in case contributing to sedation and hypotension. Patient's heart failure was treated as above with improvement in mental status.  # CAD: Patient had no current chest pain, SOB or other cardiac complaints. Troponins x2 0.05, 0.04. Consistent with previous admissions. Less likely acute cardiac ischemia. He was continued on home atorvastatin, ASA. Metoprolol as described above. 

# Pyuria: Patient found to have asymptomatic pyuria on admission with a dirty UA. He was recently treated for E. coli UTI on ___. He had no fevers or leukocytosis and urine culture only grew mixed bacterial contaminants. Therefore, it was felt the patient did not truly have a new UTI, and he did not receive any antibiotics.  # Goals of care: Patient with multiple admissions for recent heart failure exacerbations, multiple interventions with limited success in improvement of symptoms. Would likely benefit for palliative care consult for end-stage heart failure.   # Aortic Stenosis ___ TAVR in ___. No longer on Plavix (stopped on ___. 

# BPH: Continued home tamsulosin.   

===================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ===================== [ ] Medication changes: - Discontinued digoxin. - Decreased metoprolol dosing to metoprolol succinate 25mg PO QD - Decreased home torsemide to 10mg QD [ ] Consider palliative care consult given multiple admissions for heart failure exacerbations to discuss goals of care. [ ] EP follow up for pacemaker placement and rate management. [ ] Continue to monitor INR. [ ] Repeat CBC in 1 week given downtrending platelet count.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___.

Why you were admitted to the hospital: - You were very sleepy at your appointment to check your pacemaker, and your doctors were concerned ___ had extra fluid on your body.

What was done while you were in the hospital: - You had a procedure called an "AVJ Ablation" to prevent your atrial fibrillation from making your heart beat too fast. - You were given Lasix (water pill) to remove the extra fluid from your body. - Your blood pressure was low, so we changed the dosing of your metoprolol and stopped your torsemide.

What you need to do when you go home: - Please continue to take your medications as prescribed. - You are being discharged back to your rehab facility to help make you stronger. - Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely, Your ___ Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
