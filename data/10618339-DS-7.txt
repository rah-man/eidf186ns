He received ASA 325mg and was started on atorvastatin at the outside hospital. We continued the atorvastatin and his home ASA 81mg/day. He started metoprolol tartrate titrated up to 12.5mg QID, and started a heparin gtt leading up to CABG given that the patient had a brief recurrence of CP.  He was taken to the operating room on ___. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4. Please see operative note for full details. In summary he had: 1. Coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Total arterial revascularization. 2. Skeletonized left internal mammary artery sequential grafting to the diagonal and the left anterior descending artery. 3. Skeletonized free right internal mammary artery as a T graft off the left internal mammary artery to the distal circumflex. 4. Left radial artery grafting to posterior descending artery. 5. Endoscopic harvesting of the left radial artery. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on the day of surgery. He was weaned from intravenous medications, Beta blocker and nitrates were initiated and he was diuresed toward his preoperative weight. He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Beta blockers were titrated up with HR >100 for several days. He was transitioned from nitroglycerin to Imdur for radial artery graft, and should continue this for 3 months postop. ACE-I was started with preop NSTEMI. He was restarted on his home oral diabetic medications and Lantus for hyperglycemia. Chest tubes remained in an additional day due to high serous drainage. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol without complication. He was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 he was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged to ___ at ___ in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  Prevena should be removed on POD 7 (___).
