 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ female with past medical history significant for CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, partial colectomy for diverticulitis, multiple allergies including penicillins and CT contrast, who developed worsening L flank pain and n/v and found to have urosepsis from obstructing L ureteral stone now s/p L percutaneous nephrostomy tube and found to have afib with RVR.

The history is obtained by review of records as the patient is unable to provide history.

She then developed nausea and vomiting on day of presentation. She called EMS and was taken to ___ in ___. When EMS arrived she was tachypneic and tachycardic with EKG showing atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was given diltiazem and 500cc fluid. On arrival to the OSH ED she was afeb, BP 140/73, P ___, 96% RA. Exam was notable for distress secondary to pain with LLQ tenderness, b/l ___ edema. Labs were notable for a Cr 1.4, WBC 12.5, Hgb 11.0, plt 235, Trop I 0.01, ALT 48, AST 38, T bili 1.2. UA with ___, Nitrite, glu, bacteria. 

CT A/P showed moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney with a proximal ureteral calculus and surrounding inflammatory changes. A CXR showed mild CHF. She was started on a diltiazem drip at 10 mg/h with stable blood pressures for heart rates that were persisting in the 140s. She received 500 mg of IV Levaquin due to allergy to penicillin and was transferred to ___ for evaluation for nephrostomy placement.

In the ___ ED, at ___ initial vitals were T 97.0, HR 150, BP 105/67, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Exam notable for AAOx3, L CVAT.

CT abdomen without contrast was repeated here and notable for obstructing distal left ureteral stone measuring up to 7 mm, as well as collection of stones in the L renal pelvis, and possible evidence of calyceal rupture. 

She was continued on diltiazem gtt initially but became hypotensive with pressures in ___. She had received 3L IVF at OSH and 1.5L IVF here, for a total of 4.5L. Dilt gtt was discontinued and she was started on Levophed peripherally at 0.08 mcg/kg/min with improvement in BPs. Urology was consulted and recommended stat percutaneous nephrostomy tube. She was taken emergently to the ___ suite, where she was intubated for the procedure and a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed uneventfully. Intraoperatively she received 1 L of IV fluid as well as 5 mg of IV to help metoprolol and esmolol for elevated heart rates in the 150s which improved to the 1 teens. She required norepinephrine at 0.1 and phenylephrine at 2.

MICROBIOLOGY: =============== ___ BLOOD CULTURE No growth

___ URINE    ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE COMPLEX.  1,000 - 10,000 CFU/ML.      This organism may develop resistance to third generation     cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that     are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to     four days after initiation of therapy. For serious infections,     repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted     if third generation cephalosporins were used.

  Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with PMH of CAD, HTN, HLD, Pt Colectomy for diverticulitis who presented with flank pain and N/V, found to have septic shock due to infected obstructing L ureteral stone now s/p L percutaneous nephrostomy tube, with course complicated by A fib with RVR, s/p cardioversion to NSR.

ACTIVE ISSUES: = = = = = = = = ================================================================ # Septic Shock, ___ Obstructing L Ureteral Stone Presented with flank pain, found to have L hydronephrosis and L ureteral calculus. Became hypotensive and treated with IVF then started on pressors. ___ placed stat PCN tube and she was admitted to MICU. UCX grew enterobacter, treated with meropenem --> Bactrim for total 10 day course. Weaned off pressors. Plan for o/p urology & ___ f/u for consideration of stone removal and PCN tube removal. Discharged with L PCN in place. 

# A Fib with RVR v. A Flutter During ED went into A fib with RVR. First started on diltiazem, then after pressures dropped was d/c'ed. Attempted metoprolol & esmolol gtt with minimal HR control. Transitioned back to diltiazem gtt after weaning off pressors, which was tolerated well, then transitioned to PO diltiazem, later switched to metoprolol. Started on heparin gtt for AC then transitioned to Apixaban. On ___ she underwent TEE and cardioversion and subsequently remained in sinus rhythm. She was loaded with amiodarone with plan to follow up with outpatient Cardiology. 

# ___ Reportedly has history of possible CHF although no echos in our system and no known clear diagnosis of CHF. TTE here with significantly decreased EF to ___, although unclear if this is driven by sepsis &/or a fib. Treated with IV Lasix intermittently for preload reduction. Repeat TTE showed slight improvement with EF 38%. She will follow up with Cardiology as outpatient.

# Shock Liver Developed elevated transaminases in hepatocellular injury pattern around time of presentation with septic shock. RUQUS with steatosis, no vascular compromise. Thought most likely due to shock liver; resolved with time and improvement in hemodynamics.

# ___ Baseline Cr 1.0. Cr elevated to peak of 3.7. Thought to be prerenal v. ATN. Treated with diuretics, and ultimately began urinating on her own and Cr improved to near baseline.

CHRONIC ISSUES: = = = = = = = = ================================================================ # Anemia Normocytic, at baseline

# CAD ?History of CAD. No clear records to distinguish prior MI/stents. Allergic to ASA, continued atorvastatin.

# DMT2 Held oral medications; ISS.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: = = = = = = = = ================================================================ [ ] New diagnosis of HFrEF, with EF improving over hospitalization period. Will need Cardiology follow-up and further work-up including repeat TTE. Should consider starting diuresis as needed.  [ ] Abdominal ultrasound with evidence of steatosis and trace ascites, will need further work-up for possible cirrhosis (no known diagnosis) [ ] New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, s/p cardioversion. Continued on metoprolol as well as amiodarone, plan to eventually discontinue the metoprolol at least if continues in NSR. [ ] Discharged on Apixaban for AC, can be eventually discontinued as outpatient if remains in NSR [ ] Discharged on home metformin and glipizide, but did have HbA1c 9.2% and required standing insulin during admission. Consider further titration in rehab and as outpatient. Note patient will have difficulty with self-administering insulin due to chronic hand tremor. [ ] Foley removed on day of discharge, check PVRs to ensure not retaining [ ] Patient noted to have slightly elevated WBC count at discharge to 12.8. Please re-check CBC on ___ to trend. No evidence of infection on exam. [ ] Should see allergist for PCN testing to clear allergy as well as CT contrast testing (as tolerated dye for nephrostomy w/o issue) [ ] Needs urology & ___ f/u as outpatient for PCN & stone removal [ ] Non-immune to hepatitis B [ ] Consider iron repletion as outpatient
