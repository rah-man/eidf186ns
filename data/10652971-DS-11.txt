IMAGING =======

___ TTE The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 55-60%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a mildly dilated descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

___ CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  1. Stable small right subdural hematoma. No new intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Stable configuration of the ventricular system.  Approximately 3 mm leftward midline shift and partial effacement of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle.

#SDH #Encephalopathy She was admitted to neurosurgery floor for close monitoring. Eliquis (for afib) was held. She was started on keppra 500 mg bid for seizure ppx. She had increased lethargy ___ but exam remained non-focal and was easily arousable. Infectious workup was negative. Repeat CT on ___ was stable. No surgical intervention was indicated. She should continue to hold Eliquis and follow up with repeat CT in 1 month. MS improved to ___ at the time of DC.

#Wrist sprain She was evaluated by ortho for right wrist pain. XR was negative for fracture. She was ordered for a wrist splint to be worn at all times and should follow up with ortho in 2 weeks. 

#Vertigo/syncope Patient notes h/o vertigo and attributes this to fall. She was transferred to Medicine service for further work up. On medicine she was found to be orthostatic. We reduced her Torsemide dose to 10mg from alternating between 20 and 40mg. ___ require further uptitration as an outpatient. TTE did not show any aortic pathology as cause for syncope, but was notable for an improved EF to 55% (after placement of BiV pacer) from 25% previously. Her pacemaker was interrogated and showed two episodes of NSVT, neither of which corresponded to her fall. 

#HFrEF: EF 25% in ___ w/ global hypokinesis. Unclear if from CAD (prior stress test w/ apical scarring c/f prior MI), not on home ___ (?adverse reaction) or spironolactone (hyperkalemia). As above, reduced her Torsemide to 10mg. Also as above, TTE showed improvement in EF to 55%, as her last echo was done before placement of BiV device. We continued his home metoprolol. 

# SSS ___ CRT-P #AFib: Holding AC ___ SDH, will not restart until after cleared by neurosurgery with repeat head CT. COntinued home metoprolol for rate control.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

# GERD: Continued home PPI

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [] Follow-up with Ortho in 2 weeks, keep wrist splint on until then [] Call ___ for a Neurosurgery follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ in 4 weeks. Hold anticoagulation until then. Will need repeat CT Head w/o contrast at that time. [] Daughter mentioned some perineal bleeding, unclear whether vaginal, rectal or superficial. None observed during the hospitalization. Please continue to monitor for bleeding. [] 1 week Keppra course to end ___ [] As above, Torsemide dose was downtitrated to 10mg qd in the setting of orthostasis. Unclear whether orthostasis is totally attributable to Torsemide. Dose may need adjustment if pt has weight gain, shortness of breath.
