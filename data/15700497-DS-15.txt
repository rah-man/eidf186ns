Stool studies were negative for C. Diff and stool ova/parasites were pending at the time of discharge. CRP was 0.9. High ostomy output likely secondary to lack of colonic water absorption. Her home Tramadol for back pain was initially held given concern for light-headedness. She was given bolus IV lactated Ringer's with initial improvement in light-headedness.

ACTH drawn just prior to Cosyntropin administration still pending. Her adrenal insufficiency may be contributing to her subjective orthostatic symptoms of lightheadedness. [] Please continue hydrocortisone po, 10mg at 10am and 5mg at 5pm daily (patient understands that she is to triple her hydrocortisone iso acute illness, she was also provided with a prescription for rescue dexamethasone IM) [] Patient also encouraged to obtain medical alert bracelet for adrenal insufficiency in case found down [] Endocrinology follow-up.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. -You were hospitalized due to increased output from your ileostomy and dizziness.

What happened during your hospitalization? -Your stool was tested and cultured to rule out several different infections, including C. difficile and parasites, all of which were negative. -You were given intravenous fluids to rehydrate you in the setting of your increased ileostomy losses. -You were found to have elevated liver enzyme tests and underwent testing to examine the cause. A special MRI of your liver and bile ducts called an MRCP was done and revealed no concerning changes in your liver or bile duct. It did show known liver cysts and a hernia around your ileostomy site. However, your liver enzymes remained elevated, and records from the ___ were obtained that showed results consistent with an autoimmune liver disease, so you were also seen by the liver specialist doctors (___). You underwent percutaneous biopsy of the liver by the Interventional Radiology team to assist in diagnosing the cause of your elevated liver enzymes. -The gastroenterology team led by Dr. ___ was consulted to evaluate your ileostomy output and your elevated liver enzyme tests. -Your home medication Immodium were adjusted, with reduction in your ileostomy output. The Lomotil dosing was adjusted to 1 tablet 3 times/day and the Immodium dose was adjusted to 2mg 3 times/day. -You underwent an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to assess your aortic stenosis, which showed moderate progression of your aortic stenosis. -You underwent multiple blood tests to determine the cause of your dizziness. These showed insufficient production of a hormone called cortisol by your adrenal glands, so you were started on hydrocortisone replacement. - You developed severe back pain and were found to have a compression fracture in your lumbar spine (level L4). You were given medications for pain.

What should you do when you leave the hospital? - Continue to take all of your medications as prescribed - Follow-up with your specialty health care appointments as listed below - You were started on hydrocortisone upon discharge. Please continue to take this medication as prescribed (10 mg in the morning at 10AM and 5 mg at 5PM) until advised at either your hepatology or your endocrinology appointment. In the interim, if you develop an illness such as the cold or flu, please take a triple dose of hydrocortisone, 30 mg in the morning and 15 in the evening, for 3 days. If you continue to feel unwell or if you are nauseous and unable to take oral medications, please self-administer intramuscular injection of dexamethasone into the thigh and come to the emergency room.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team  Followup Instructions: ___
