___ EKG: Atrial fibrillation. Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ findings are similar. 

___ CXR: Left lower lobe pneumonia, small left effusion, stable loculated right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly. 

___ CXR: In comparison with the study of ___, there is persistent opacification at the left base consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and effusion. The loculated right pleural effusion is decreasing in size. The degree of pneumomediastinum has substantially decreased. Midline sternal wires remain in place. 

___ TTE: The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basl inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect.

There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ CXR: No new acute cardiopulmonary process. Persistent but imrproving left lower lobe opacity, improved compared to ___. Small pleural effusions are also decreasing. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ male with history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD (2L NC home O2 requirement), congestive heart failure (EF 50%), diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, melanoma presents with likely pneumonia, CHF and COPD exacerbation.

# Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray. He had an increased O2 requirement to 4L NC (from 2L NC at home). The patient was treated with a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Blood cultures were negative. His white count and symptoms improved. The cough was persistent though improving at time of discharge. The patient remained afebrile and his oxygen requirement returned to normal. The patient will need a follow up chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution.

# Acute on chronic congestive heart failure: The patient presented with evidence of gross hypervolemia. The patient had a TTE which showed an EF of 50% (for full report please see OMR). The patients respiratory status improved greatly after diuresis. The patient was started on torsemide 20mg PO daily with maintained hypovolemia. While he was inpatient his I/Os and weights were closely monitored. He was also continued on lisinopril and metoprolol succinate. He will need close monitoring as an outpatient to ensure that 20mg of torsemide is the proper diuretic dose.

# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient has a recent worsening of his pulmonary process. He carries a diagnosis of chronic obstructive disease. He is on 2L NC at home. Initially he required 4L NC to maintain SaO2, however this was weaned with the above treatments. Pulmonary was consulted and recommended prednisone 50mg PO x5 with no taper. The patient got this medication and felt much improved. The patient was also maintained on Advair inhaler, albuterol nebs and tiotropium inhaler. The patient was discharged on resting 2L NC O2 sat and ambulatory 4L NC O2 sat.  # Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. He is rate controlled on metoprolol tartrate. His dose of metoprolol tartrate was decreased to 25mg BID while in the hospital. He does become bradycardic at times but remained asymptomatic. He was discharged on metoprolol succinate. The patient was maintained on warfarin with an INR goal of ___. His INR prior to discharge was subtherapeutic. This will need to be monitored closely with adjustments to his coumadin dosing as needed.

# Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient is maintained on oral agents at home. He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale as an inpatient. While he was on prednisone his diabetes was poorly controlled, likely secondary to steroid effect. He will be continued on an insulin sliding scale while at rehab. He will need to have this discontinued and be restarted on his oral regimen once his prednisone is complete. Fingersticks should be checked at rehab.

# Hypertension: The patient was well controlled on lisinopril and metoprolol tartrate. His lisinopril dose was increased to 20mg daily and his metoprolol tartrate dose was decreased to 25mg BID. This should be followed as an outpatient to ensure adequate blood pressure control. 

# Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis: This was likely secondary to aggresive diuresis as an inpatient. The patient received multiple doses of acetazolamide. This was monitored with labs and improved by discharge.

# Hyperlipidemia: The patient was continued on resuvastatin 5mg PO qhs.
