 # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA secondary to #GI BLEED: Patient had a recent admission for GI bleed, with colonoscopy showing ulcerations in the terminal ileum. Discharge Hgb at that time was ~8, with a drop to 6.2 on admission. No evidence of critical ischemia or syncope. He received 2 units of PRBC on admission with an appropriate hemoglobin bump. The patient had several episodes of melena and BRBPR while admitted. He remained hemodynamically stable. Given the fact that he had an EGD and colonoscopy on his last recent admission, he underwent capsule endoscopy, which showed duodenitis and gastric erosions, with no active bleeding. The conclusion was that his bleed was likely diverticular. The pt will see colorectal surgery as an outpatient for evaluation of hemorrhoids, as they may be contributing to symptoms.

 #Kidney transplant/Immunosuppression: Continued current prophylactic regimen: Tacrolimus 8mg BID, Prednisone 5mg. Switched Bactrim to atovaquone 1500 daily, as Bactrim can contribute to leukopenia. 

 # Oral Candidiasis: Minimal thrush on admission exam. Continued on nystatin 5 mL QID x14 days. 

 # Hypertension: Held amlodipine 5mg in setting of GIB. Restarted on discharge. 

 # DM2: Continued glargine 6U at breakfast and Humalog ISS. 

 # Latent Tuberculosis: Continued isoniazid ___ PO daily and pyridoxine 100mg PO  daily.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. 

WHY DID YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL? You noticed blood in your stool.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE HERE? - We gave you blood transfusions to keep your blood levels up. - We performed a "capsule endoscopy", which means that you swallowed a small camera so that we could search your intestines for bleeding. The results were not much different from the previous endoscope and colonoscopy that you had, and the capsule study did not show any active bleeding. It was likely a vein that bled from your known diverticulosis. There is nothing to do for this except to come back to the hospital if you have more blood in your bowel movements. You should follow up with colorectal surgery to consider having your hemorrhoids evaluated. - Medication changes: we stopped your Bactrim and started At___, because this is better for your blood counts. We decreased your Tacrolimus to 7 mg every 12 hours - Please get labs checked on ___

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - As always, it is important that you continue to take your medications as directed, and follow up with all of your doctors. 

 Again, it was a pleasure taking care of you!

Best,

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
