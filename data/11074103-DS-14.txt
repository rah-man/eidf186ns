In the immediate post operative period she experienced hypotension initially treated with crystalloid which was ineffective so phenylephrine drip was initiated with good effect. She was maintained on this drip overnight into the morning of POD1 when this was discontinued and her pressures were in the ___ to low 100s so a bolus of albumin was given with moderate effect. She complained of some right hand numbness thought to be possibly related to carpal tunnel syndrome or positioning in the operating room. She had surgically corrected CTS on the left side.

Otherwise she tolerated a regular diet, was able to urinate independently after surgery, and her pain was well controlled. She will receive ___ at home for blood pressure and neuro checks.
