 History of Present Illness: ___ is a ___ woman with a history of HTN, HLD, a-fib s/p ablation, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and recent diagnosis of polymyositis who presents 2 months of progressive proximal weakness and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. History is provided by the patient, who is a retired ICU ___. 

Near the end of ___ she had been in her usual state of health and was doing housework, when her left arm became very weak at the shoulder and she was unable to lift it appreciably. It had been completely normal earlier in the day, but she now had to prop her arm up against the wall to put on deodorant, for example. Her strength was preserved in her biceps, triceps, wrist, and hand. She went to a ___ clinic where X-rays were performed. She was told her "shoulder and neck were a mess" and given a 7 day taper of prednisone, reportedly to treat a musculoskeletal etiology. 

She saw her PCP in the beginning of ___ who thought it might be a radiculopathy. He ordered an MRI, which diagnosed degenerative joint disease, so she is referred to a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon assessed that the problem was in the shoulder, not in the neck, and referred her to a neurologist. A few days later, she also began to develop weakness in her left leg. She could no longer get off the toilet or out of bed herself. Her husband had to lift her and help to get dressed. 

Her neurologist (Dr. ___ ___ suspected myasthenia ___, and ordered a nerve conduction study/EMG,  the results of which suggested polymyositis. She was also told that she had rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's (though this may mean, rather, that she was positive for rheumatoid factor and ___. She had an elevated CPK. She was also reportedly MUSK positive. She says she has many other labs pending from ___. 

Around this time in early ___, her hearing acutely worsened. She noticed it very suddenly one day while out with her husband -- it had been normal in the morning, and significantly worsened suddenly after they got home. She also began to have dry mouth. 

Towards the end of ___, she noticed some weakness in both hands and was having difficulty holding plates when she was washing the dishes. Her right leg also started to become weak. 

In the beginning of ___ she was eating ___ toast cut up into small pieces, and it became stuck high in her esophagus. Though this may have been partly associated with her dry mouth, she would also cough when drinking water. She has since been taking only protein shakes and thickened slushies. She has lost 31 lbs since ___. 

Her neurologist prescribed her a 17 day course of prednisone ___. It started at 60mg daily and decreased by 10mg every 3 days. She took her final dose of 10mg this past ___. 

Prior to this, she had not been walking at all since her symptoms started. She had been using a wheelchair and her husband's constant assistance. About 2 weeks ago (roughly coinciding with the steroid course), she started using a walker, and became able to get out of bed and off of a toilet on her own (though she is not sure how much of this is from improved strength vs new strategies). 

Since ___ she noticed she was "grunting" breathing more heavily with standing and activity. She also felt that when she stood for too long, her shoulders became uncomfortable, feeling like they were just "hanging there". (The says this was an unusual sensation, but doesn't know how better to describe it.) Today she was feeling increasingly weak, and felt that she needed IV fluids so she went to ___. She was subsequently transferred to ___.

On admission patient was also continued on prednisone 10mg daily (prednisone was started by the outpatient Neurologist on ___ for the muscle weakness, initially at 60mg daily, then tapered to 10mg daily. It was increased to 60mg on ___ given patients respiratory status, low NIF's -20 to -30 and VC ~ 1L. She was also started on IVIG 25mg daily x 5 days ___ (~2g/kg divided into 5 days).

Rheumatology was consulted and following. Patient underwent an extensive work-up including autoimmune, inflammatory, demeylinating, and neoplastic origin. CK was elevated (143), CRP 13.5, ESR 29, ___ titers were strongly positive (1:320), dsDNA negative, lupus anticoagulant negative, B2 GLYCOPROTEIN I IgG/IgM/IgA neg, ANCA NEGATIVE, cardiolipin Ab IgG negative; however, cardiolipin Ab IgM was elevated (placing the patient in the intermiediate catergory), SJOGREN'S ANTIBODY (SS-A)>8.0 positive, and SJOGREN'S ANTIBODY (SS-B) <1.0 negative. ___. Given positivity to multiple serologic symptoms, patient's serologic studies are most consistent with an overlap syndrome. 

Additionally to the labs listed above, serum myositis antibody profile was sent and is still pending, aldolase is 10.2 (elevated) - which would be expected in diseases affecting the muscle, C3 WNL, C4 only minimally elevated. Paraneoplastic panel was added to the serum sample from ___ (oldest available, but after 2 doses of IVIG).

EMG done on ___ was abnormal, showed moderate-to-severe, generalized myopathy with associated denervating features, as seen in inflammatory myositis. R deltoid muscle biopsy was completed on ___, final read pending; however, per prelim interpretation by Dr. ___ biopsied tissue is notable for mild-non specific changes, no obvious inflammation. 

MRI Brain w/ brainstem cuts was performed due to concern for bulbar involvement and it was unremarkable. Given that paraneoplastic syndrome was on the differential, CT of the torso was performed to rule out malignancy, it revealed enlarged cervical lymph node at the base of the neck on the R side, the lesion was biopsied by FNA and was positive for metastatic carcinoma, primary tumor site unclear (see details regarding further work-up below). 

Neurologically, patient has shown significant improvement in strength and continues to improve, hearing loss on the R side improved.

# Enlarged lymph node w/ poorly differentiated carcinoma CT of the torso on ___ demonstrated a 3cmx2.9cm R cervical lymph node at 5b level, nonspecific enlarged celiac and porta hepatis lymph nodes with celiac node measuring up to 28 x 12 mm, and 1 x 0.9 cm soft tissue lesion is seen within the upper inner right breast, no other findings concerning for malignancy noted. CT Neck ___: redemonstrated enlarged lymph node on the R side at the base of the neck: 28mmx30mmx28mm (5b level). The R neck lymph node was biopsied by FNA on ___ and it was positive for malignant cells consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma. Hem-Onc was consulted and recommended further investigation to identify the primary tumor. Differential diagnosis includes luminal lesions not visualized on CT such as colon/gastric cancer, as well as breast cancer, head/neck cancer. Family Hx is notable for colon cancer and her last colonoscopy was many years ago. She was doing fecal occult testing yearly which was always negative, last one about ___ years ago. GI was consulted for EGD and EUS biopsy of celiac LN as this is the only other area of concern on imaging. Plan for procedures ___, bowel prep on ___. Also checking iron studies (iron, ferritin, TIBC) since iron deficiency may be related to GI malignancy and chronic blood loss. LDH elevated, uric acid sent and pending.

The location of her node in the posterior triangle at level 5b could also be suspicious for head/neck cancer or thyroid cancer. Laryngeal ca can present should be considered if nothing is found on GI tract exploration. Considering her history of ___'s thyroiditis, she is at increased risk for thyroid lymphoma and papillary thyroid cancer, but these would tend to be more indolent, and no concerning lesions were found on CT neck. 

Of note, patient has a lesion in the R breast, which was followed by serial ultrasounds and mammograms, per patient previously identified as benign cystic lesion, no records available for review yet. Given the history and newly found lymph node with evidence of matastatic disease, decision was made to repeat mammogram (despite the fact that last one was completed in ___ - reportedly unchanged). However, unable to complete mammogram since patient unable to stand. Unilateral US of the breast was completed and showed solid lesion, core biopsy was completed and specimen was sent to Pathology. 

Surgery also consulted for potential excisional biopsy of the R neck lymph node per Hem-Onc recs; however, will ___ until completion of endoscopic GI procedures. If nothing is found on GI scopes, would consider having ENT perform laryngoscopy to assess for head/neck cancer

Subsequently the patient was found to have elevated CA 125 and preliminary pathology from celiac node biopsy consistent with GYN primary from Mullerian origin. Gyn onc was consulted and recommended chemotherapy, and no need for surgical staging at this point. Imaging was only remarkable for endometrial thickening on pelvic ultrasound. Patient was presented at tumor board and decision was made to treat with ****. 

The patient also underwent lumbar puncture to rule out leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which revealed CSF with no malignant cells. 

Patient began chemotherapy C1D1 ___ on ___.  # Respiratory weakness Patient monitored in NIMU throughout admission, Q6H NIF/VC. NIF's ranged from -30 to -12, VC .___, but improved to -35 to -20 at time of transfer to the OMED service.

Prior EMG concerning for polymyositis. However, muscle bx from ___ with prelim read showing mild-non specific changes, no obvious inflammation. Overall, the clinical presentation consistent with probable paraneoplastic syndrome. So far rheum workup revealing for SSA + and elevated CRP. Workup thus far notable for enlarged supraclavicular cervical LAD w/ FNA biopsy revealing malignant cells and poorly differentiated carcinoma, primary unclear & celiac and porta hepatis LAD on abd CT. Now with elevated CA 125 and preliminary pathology from celiac node biopsy consistent with GYN primary.

___ paraneoplastic antibody panel notable for P/Q-type calcium channel antibody elevated at 0.05 and striated muscle antibody positive at titer of 1:7680, both of which are consistent with presumed paraneoplastic syndrome. There is at least one case report of myasthenia ___ in a patient with a malignant mixed Mullerian tumor of the uterine corpus (Gynecology Oncology, ___, Volume 64, Issue 3, Pages ___ no neurological symptoms followed diagnosis of the cancer, rather than preceding it as in the case of this patient. In terms of the P/Q-type calcium channel antibody, a recent review of 236 ___ patients with positive voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies found in evaluation for paraneoplastic neurological autoimmunity, there was only one patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma and only one other patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.

Patient continued to improve and NIF monitoring was discontinued prior to discharge.  # Cardiovascular: A-fib: s/p ablation, HTN Sotalol stopped due to lower BP's. Subsequently patient became hypertensive SBP 150-180's and metoprolol was started and dose increased as needed to 25mg BID. Labetalol ___ mg IV Q6H was used PRN for the following parameters: for SBP >160 hold for HR <60, SBP <90. Patient remained persistently hypertensive and amlodipine 5mg was added. 

# Positive Urinalysis on admission: UTI vs contamination -Treated with ceftriaxone (___) given clinical scenario and concern for UTI -URINE CULTURE ___ (Final): GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA. Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.< 10,000 CFU/m

#Thrombocytopenia and VTE prophylaxis: Initially started on Heparin SC BID. However, PLT dropped gradually from 134 on day of presentation to 83 (~39%). Concern was raised regarding Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia, since patient scored 4 on the 4Ts score which classified her as intermediate risk. All heparin products were stopped and patient was switched to fondaparinux SQ. PF4 Heparin Antibody was sent on ___ and returned negative for HIT. Patient was subsequently restarted on SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

#FEN/GI: On admission, patient endorsed dysphagia to all consistencies of food; however, most prominently to solids. Bedside swallow evaluation was conducted by Speech Therapy and patient was deemed unsafe for PO feeds. NG tube was placed on ___ and she was started on continuous feeds with Jevity 1.2, goal rate to meet nutritional needs is 55ml/h. On ___, immediately after 5 doses of IVIG, there was a video swallow study which revealed aspiration with nectar and thin consistencies. Additionally during the video swallow study, there was a concern that patient was not activating any of her swallow muscles. NG tube feeds were continued. Plan to repeat video prior to 2 weeks of placement of NG tube. If patient does not show improvement in swallowing, she may require G-tube placement.

Glucose was monitored closely during the admission, due to chronic use of steroids. Patient was started sliding scale insulin.

There was no bladder or bowel incontinence, except for 1 episode of bowel incontinence when patient's stool became more loose, presumably due to the the formula.

#HTN: Home sotalol held on admission but started metoprolol to 25mg BID and amlodipine 5mg daily, on labetalol PRN for SBP >160. Recent pressures 140-150s/80s. ___ need further titration. On discharge***

#Dysphagia: History of dysphagia i/s/o proximal muscle weakness and concern for bulbar involvement. Bedside swallow eval deemed patient unsafe for PO feeds, NG tube placed for feeds. Repeat swallow eval prior to discharge shows improvement but ongoing need for NG tube. Patient discharged with NG tube. 

#GERD: Continued home regimen of ranitidine. 

#Social: - Health Care Proxy: ___, husband (___) - Husband aware of undergoing work-up for primary cancer, not all children are aware yet, patient wishes to inform them at a later time 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ===================== - Please follow up Myositis antibody panel and endometrial biopsy results that were pending at the time of discharge. - PICC removed prior to discharge, ensure patient receives a port prior to chemotherapy. - LFTs slightly elevated prior to discharge. Thought to be chemotherapy effect, please monitor. - Discharged with Dobhoff and tube feeds. If patient does not have rapid recovery of dysphasia, can consider G-tube placement. Patient will have home speech/swallow therapy. Will need repeat video swallow in ___ weeks. - Please monitor blood glucose and downtitrate insulin regimen as steroids are tapered.
