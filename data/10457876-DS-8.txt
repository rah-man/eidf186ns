 History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with kappa anaplastic plasma cell myeloma diagnosed in ___ with extensive skull, pelvic, and hip involvement as well as trace B-J proteinuria, 30% plasma cell involvement and unfavorable cytogenetics s/p radiation to skull and iliac masses, and Velcade/dex with significant FLC and BM response, s/p 6 autoSCT (___) who was on ___ maintenance but has a recent relapse with bony disease and iliac mass now presenting for Cytoxan

 Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:

Ms. ___ developed sudden-onset right lateral hip pain in ___. She had a similar episode ___ years prior that resolved with physical therapy. She was initially diagnosed with bursitis and was referred to physical therapy, with which her pain only slightly improved. She had difficulty walking normally. Plain films of the hips on ___ showed a possible lucent lesion within the right iliac bone. Follow-up MRI reportedly was consistent with a large destructive right iliac mass with soft tissue components, additional lesion in the femoral neck shaft, pelvis and sacrum.

She was evaluated by Dr. ___ on ___, who felt the imaging was most consistent with multiple myeloma with some extra-skeletal soft tissue component versus lymphoma. She underwent CT torso on ___ (see below) followed by U/S-guided biopsy of the soft tissue mass in the right iliac bone on ___. A bone scan was obtained on ___. This showed concerning findings in the skull, for which the patient was referred to the ED and admitted.

While she was hospitalized, head MRI was obtained which showed numerous calvarial masses, with the largest invading the dura and compressing the occipital lobe. Neurosurgery and Neuro-Onc (Dr. ___ were consulted, and felt that she was safe for discharge with close outpatient follow-up. Kappa LCs returned significantly elevated. Immunoglobulins were all reduced. She had no other end-organ dysfunction, but we did recommend holding NSAIDs and starting opiates instead for hip pain to prevent renal dysfunction. She was discharged on ___. In the meantime, pathology was reviewed and confirmed an anaplastic plasma cell myeloma.

She was readmitted ___ to begin C1 Velcade/dex with concurrent radiation of her head. BM biopsy that day showed a subset of plasma cells with anaplastic features comprising 30% of the marrow cellularity. Hip MRI on ___ showed diffuse metastatic disease throughout the pelvic bones and proximal femurs with a dominant lesion in the right iliac bone extending into the right acetabulum and the adjacent soft tissues; overall, these lesions appeared unchanged in number and mildly increased in size from the ___ exam; the degree of involvement of the right supra-acetabular iliac bone, likely poses is a risk for pathologic fracture of the acetabular roof. Skeletal survey showed extensive disease in calvarium and R pelvis. Facial CT on ___ showed a large lytic lesion in the body of the right mandible with erosion into the adjacent soft tissue, and additional lesions involving the right mandibular condyle and ramus.

She was given dex ___ mg daily x 4 days and Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 IV. She was discharged ___. Her free kappa decreased from 350.9 to 23.8 after one cycle with Velcade/dex and radiation therapy. She completed 3500 cGy radiation on ___. 

BM biopsy ___ showed 30% plasma cells and complex karyotype including gain of odd number chromosomes, monosomy 13, and der(14)t(11;14). At least two related neoplastic clones were detected, indicative of cytogenetic evolution. Concurrent FISH showed monosomy 13 and partial deletion of IGH, likely resulted from der(14)t(11;14).
