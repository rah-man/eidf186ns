 History of Present Illness: Pt is an ___ with PMHx of Atrial Fibrillation, DVT, HTN, HLD, CKD (stage III), and ?CAD, who presents from his nursing home with crushing chest pain this morning. 

He was in his USOH until 3 days prior to admission, when he developed nausea and vomiting. On AM of DOA, as he awoke and was getting dressed, he developed crushing ___, non-radiating sub-sternal chest pain. 

On ROS, he reports occasional ___ edema but denies a hx of CP, DOE, orthopnea, recent edema, fever, chills, BRBPR, blood in emesis, dysuria, cough, congestion, melena. Of note, pt was admitted ___ to ___ for bradycardia and was diagnosed with DVT at the time (thought to be ___ THR). 

In ___, pt was found to have VS: BP 153/48, P ___, R 28, O2 Sat 97%. He was given ASA 162mg and transferred to ___. He also received ASA 325mg po x 1 by EMS and Nitro x 2 without improvement, as well as fentanyl 100mcg prior to arrival.  In the ED, initial vitals were not recorded. ECG showed ST elevations V2-V6, q waves in inferior leads, and pt was taken immediately to the cath lab. In the cath lab, immediately prior to procedure, he went into Vfib arrest. He received chest compressions, Atropine x 1 epi x 1, and lidocaine and shock x 2 before breif ROSC. He then again went into VFIB arrest and required amiodarone and 1 additional shock. He was intubated and received Heparin IV 3K. Catheterization was done with bivilarudin and pt was transitioned to integrillin gtt after cath. Pt also developed HoTN (80/70) after receiving fentanyl and was started on IV Dopamine. This rose his HR to 130 with SBP in the 80 range so pt was transitioned to neosynephrine.  Initial labs significant for Cr 1.5, INR 1.1, lactate 1.1. Post-arrest, intubated ABG 7.26/44/382 on CMV, TnT 0.02, Cr 1.5 and lactate 3.8. 

During the cath, he was found to have large mid-distal LAD lesion (100% occlusion) and 40% occlusion of another mid-LAD area. He undewent balloon dilatation and placement of a DES. IABP was not placed given discussion with HCP mid-cath (please see below). RHC was done and showed PCWP of ___, RAP of ___, IVC O2 76 % SVC 70% RA 63 RV 68 PA 62 on FiO2 60. CO was 6.5 and CI was 3.3. 

On arrival to the floor, patient was mentating well on the vent and was able to answer all questions appropriately and complained only of some residual chest pain. CXR confirmed ETT placement and ABG was normal on PSV so pt was extubated succesfully within several minutes of arrival. Of note, per HCP, pt wished to be DNR/DNI but NH paperwork indicated pt was FC. HCP wishes were not yet known at the time of the arrest. Later, after extubation, pt made explicitly clear that he wishes to be full code and was comfortable with all interventions. 

He had an episode of bloody emesis 4 hrs after extubation. He also continued to be tachycardic to 130s. He received metop 2.5mg IV x 1, and SBP fell to ___. He required increase in phenylephrine for BP supoprts but HR normalized with time.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LCx and RCA had no angiographically apparent, flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD had discrete proximal disease with 100% occlusion in its mid portion, deemed the culprit vessel. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed slightly elevated left and right sided filling pressures (mPCWP 14, RVEDP 14 mmHg). The cardiac output and index were preserved, at 6.6/3.4, respectively. The inital cardiac output measurements were falsely elevated because it did not take into account dissolved oxygen. 3. Successful PCI of mid LAD occlusion with drug coated stent. 4. Adequate hemostasis was obtained at the arteriotomy site with a 6 ___ Angioseal VIP. . ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. LV systolic function appears depressed. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Limited study. Depressed left ventricular systolic function with a left ventricular apical aneurysm. Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mild aortic regurgitation. . TTE ___: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ___. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function in the setting of a left ventricular apical aneurysm. No apical left ventricular thrombus seen with contrast study. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the overall findings are similar. Contrast imaging of the left ventricle (not previously performed) does not show a thrombus. 

 Brief Hospital Course: MR. ___ is an ___ with PMHx of Atrial Fibrillation, DVT, HTN, HLD, CKD (stage III), CAD and dementia, who presented from his nursing home with CP and was found to have anterior/lateral STEMI and developed VF arrest. He presented to the CCU sp resuscitation and s/p DES to LAD. . >> ACTIVE ISSUES: # STEMI: In the ED the patient was found to have STEMI. He was taken for cardiac catherization an in the cath lab, immediately prior to procedure, he went into Vfib arrest. He received chest compressions, Atropine x 1, epi x 1, and lidocaine and shock x 2 before brief ROSC. He then again went into VFIB arrest and required amiodarone and 1 additional shock. He was intubated and received Heparin IV 3K. Catheterization was done with bivilarudin and pt was transitioned to integrillin gtt after cath. Pt also developed HoTN (80/70) after receiving fentanyl and was started on IV Dopamine and later transitioned to neosynephrine in the setting of elevated heart rates and low blood pressures. The patient was transfered to the CCU for monitoring where neosynephrine was weaned over ___. There was no clear precipitant of his ischemic event. Pt was vomiting for several days prior to STEMI and this may represent ongoing ischemia vs. possible viral illness as a precipitant. In the CCU the patient was continued on ASA 325 to 81mg, Plavix 75. Intregrillin x6hrs. Atorva 80. Beta blocker restarted when BPs stable for HR control. Low dose ACEI then started. TTE showed apical left ventricular aneurysm with EF of ___. Heparin gtt bridge to coumadin for apical aneurysm in addition to h/o DVT and afib. Pt with recurrent hypotension so beta blockade and ACEI subsequently held and then restarted when BPs stable. . # VF arrest, Chest wall pain ___ CPR: Likely primary as result of STEMI/ischemia. The patient was monitored on tele during this admission and no further concerning dysrhythmias were observed during his stay. Pt had lidocaine patch placed and heating pads for chest wall discomfort ___ CPR. Pt with persistent severe chest wall pain from CPR for which oxycodone started and uptitrated. Pt's pain remained an issue, limiting his activity level. Pain service was consulted and oxycodone changed to dilaudid with gabapentin at HS. . # Atrial Fibrillation: Per ___ rehab facility, he has a history of AF. Of note, this is not listed as a problem on his admission to ___ in ___ and is not listed as a problem on a cardiology note on ___. However, per rehab he was on coumadin for double indication of DVT and AF. Pt restarted on heparin gtt bridge to coumadin. Metop restarted for rate control. . # Hypotension: Likely ___ STEMI ie cardiogenic shock. Patient required a-agonist as dopamine caused tachycardia. No evidence of infection. Phenylephrine weaned per above. . # Coffee ground emesis: Pt noted to have single episode of coffee ground emesis on ___ thought to be stress ulcer vs ___ tear vs trauma from OG placement after intubation. Pt received 1u pRBCs on ___ and Hct remained stable without recurrent episodes. Pt maintained on PPI.
