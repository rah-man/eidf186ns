Acute issues:

#Pneumonia He had a chest xray with atelectasis but clinical picture felt to be consistent with pneumonia. Flu negative. CTX/azithro was started in the ED. Patient well appearing, switched to levofloxacin on admission , and completed this course with defervescence and no fever for days.

#Right wrist pain and swelling: No acute fracture or dislocation. Possible tenosynovitis of the right thumb. Seen by hand surgery who recommended volar splinting mainly for comfort. He continued to have pain, and progressive decreased movement of the hand. He was treated for 3 days with prednisone in case this represented gout, but without significant improvement. He was treated with tramadol for pain control. With therapy, his hand movement improved, but he is at risk for loss of range of motion without therapy.
