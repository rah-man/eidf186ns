ECHO ___ PRE-BYPASS: 

 The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Aortic valve stenosis is moderate by calculated valve area (1.1 cm2) , gradient (mean = 27 mmHg) and dimensionless index (0.28). (Of note, an outpatient TTE demonstrated ___ of 0.7-0.8 cm2 with associated symptoms. In the setting of the calcified leaflets and symptomatology, as well as prior measurements consistent with severe AS, it is appropriate to proceed with valve replacement). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 POST-BYPASS:

 The patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving a phenylephrine infusion (being titrated) and epinephrine 0.01 mcg/kg/min. Left ventricular systolic function remains preserved. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is in the aortic position (25 Epic). There is normal trileaflet opening and no regurgitation. Peak gradient across the valve is 15 mmHg; mean gradient is 9 mmHg. There are expected post-surgical changes of the aortic root. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are trivial. The thoracic aorta is intact following decannulation.

PA/LAT CXR: ___  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been removed. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. There are small pleural effusions bilaterally, more prominent on the right, with underlying compressive atelectasis. No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. 

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where the patient underwent tissue aortic valve replacement. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. POD 2 pt went into a rapid afib requiring po amio load and IV Lopressor. He is currently intermittent afib and will be follow by the ___ clinic associated with his cardiologist Dr. ___. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication. PA/ Lateral CXR done on POD 4 without evidence of PYX or effusion. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
