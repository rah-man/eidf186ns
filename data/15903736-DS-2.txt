ERCP Normal major papilla. Cannulation was successful using a sphincterotome and hands free technique. An irregular 2cm stricture was noted in the distal CBD was upstream dilation to 12mm. On pancreatogram, an irregular stricture was noted as the duct coursed through the head of the pancreas. Given stricture in both ducts, there was high suspicion for malignancy arising in the head of the pancreas. A limited sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the distal CBD (stricture). A 7cm by ___ ___ biliary stent was placed successfully. 

Pathology: COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHINGS: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS Consistent with adenocarcinoma 

CT Chest -IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of malignancy in the chest. 2. There is moderate bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.

CTA Pancreas -IMPRESSION: 1. Hypodense pancreatic head mass measuring 2.5 x 2.6 cm with surrounding fat stranding extending into the duodenum, though the fat plane between the mass and the duodenum is preserved. 2. Conventional vascular anatomy. 3. No vascular involvement. 4. Fluid within the endometrial cavity. Further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound is recommended given patient's age.   Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o F with no significant PMHx other than recently found mass in the HOP, admitted for monitoring following EUS/ERCP.

Patient underwent ERCP with sphx, brushings for cytology, and stent placement. She tolerated procedure well, and diet was advanced the following day. Cytology returned positive for adenocarcinoma after discharge, and CA ___ returned elevated as well. The patient is scheduled to f/u in pancreas ___ on ___ ___. Staging CT done prior to discharge.

Of note, staging CT did report fluid in the endometrial cavity. Pelvic ultrasound was recommended for further evaluation.

She will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks for stent pull and consideration of metal stent insertion.
