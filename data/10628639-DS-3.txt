CTAP: Right femoral hernia containing mildly dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding and fluid in the hernia sac, which is distended. Appendix appears to be pinched proximally where it enters the hernia sac. This study is not diagnostic for coinciding appendicitis, but the possibility should be considered. Right femoral vein is partially compressed by the hernia. 

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on ___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed right femoral hernia containing mildly dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding. WBC was not elevated. The patient underwent repair of incarcerated right femoral hernia with mesh plug placement and a partial appendectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating sips, on IV fluids, and IV/PO analgesia for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable. . On POD1, the patient had several vaso-vagal episodes, with symptomatic bradycardia. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was transferred to the ICU overnight for observation. The patient was started on theophylline, and transferred back to the floor on POD2. She was hemodynamically stable. 

When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. . At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient was discharged home without services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. She was continuing the theophylline until her follow-up appointment with her PCP next week.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with rigth groin pain. You underwent a cat scan which showed a right inguinal hernia containing a segement of your appendix. You were taken to the operating room to have the hernia repair and a portion of your appendix removed. Post-operatively, you experienced vaso-vagal episodes with a low heart rate and dizziness. You were monitored closely in the ICU for one day, and started on a medication, theophylline. You should continue to take this until your follow-up appointment with your PCP, at which point you can discuss stopping it. You are slowly recovering from the surgery and you are preparing for discharge home with the following instructions:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the appointment listed below.  ACTIVITY:  o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and feel you could respond in an emergency. o You may climb stairs. o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. o Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap. o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you can resume tub baths or swimming.  HOW YOU MAY FEEL: o You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during surgery. o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You might feel somewhat depressed. o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem unappealing. o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.  YOUR INCISION: o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay). o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is normal. o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision. o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area. o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told otherwise. o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call your surgeon. o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may resume tub baths or swimming.  YOUR BOWELS: o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  PAIN MANAGEMENT: o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more medicine at one time than prescribed. o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your pain gets too severe. o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your surgeon has said its okay. o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of pain medicine. o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - pain that is getting worse over time - pain accompanied by fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain  MEDICATIONS: Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
