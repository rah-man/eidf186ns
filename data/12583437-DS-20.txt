ON DISCHARGE:

___: Alert and oriented x3. PERRL. EOMs intact. Face symmetrical. Tongue midline. No pronator drift. Moves all extremities ___ throughout. Crani staples intact. Incision well approximated with no erythema, no drainage.  Pertinent Results: ___ ___

FINDINGS:  There is a predominately isodense subdural hemorrhage with some hyperdense components anteriorly and layering posteriorly along the right cranial convexity which measures approximately 12 mm in greatest thickness. This results in approximately 13 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures and effacement of sulci within the right cerebral hemisphere. There is effacement of the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle. Basal cisterns are patent.   The orbits are unremarkable. Imaged paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are essentially clear. The bony calvarium appears intact.   IMPRESSION:  Isodense acute/subacute subdural hematoma along the right cranial convexity. This results in effacement of sulci within the right cerebral hemisphere as well as 13 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures. 

___ ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Postsurgical changes related to interval right frontal craniotomy, subdural hematoma evacuation and subdural drain placement, with residual acute and subacute hemorrhage within the right subdural space, with acute component measuring up to 1.2 cm. 2. Interval decrease right to left midline shift, now measuring approximately 7 mm. 

___ ___ IMPRESSION:  1. Postsurgical changes related to right frontal craniotomy with subdural evacuation and placement of a right subdural drain. Residual acute and subacute hemorrhage is noted decreased in size since prior examination. 2. Persistent right-to-left midline shift. 

___ NCHCT IMPRESSION:   Stable mixed density right hemispheric subdural hematoma with unchanged location of the subdural drain, and unchanged degree of leftward shift of the midline structures. 

___ NCHCT IMPRESSION:  1. No significant change in size of mixed density right frontal subdural hematoma following drainage catheter removal. 2. Persistent leftward shift of the midline structures, also stable. 

___ NCHCT IMPRESSION:   1. No significant interval change in the mixed-density right subdural collection with persistent 9-mm left shift of normally midline structures.  2. Expected post-craniotomy changes otherwise. 

 Brief Hospital Course: On ___, the patient presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressive headache. ___ revealed an acute on subacute subdural hematoma along the right cranial convexity with 13mm midline shift. He was admitted to the neurosurgical service.

On ___, he went to the operating room with Dr. ___ a right craniotomy for subdural hematoma evacuation. His operative course was uncomplicated. He was extubated and transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Post-operative CT showed post-op changes, subdural drain placement, and resdidual acute and subacute 1.2cm hemorrhage component in the subdural space and a 7mm midline shift.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically stable with subdural drain in place. Repeat head CT showed decrease in residual hemorrhage. He remained on bedrest with the drain leveled at the shoulder.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically stable. He had slightly elevated coags, so removal of the subdural drain was deferred and hematology was consulted and labs were ordered including inhibitor screen, Factor VII and LFT's. The patient was started on 1 of 3 doses of Vitamin K for INR reversal. Head CT was grossly stable and HOB restriction was liberalized. 

On ___, the patient was transferred to the floor. Per hematology, inhibitor screen was unable to be run as PTT was not elevated. Factor VII was slightly elevated, but did not explain coagulopathy. TEG was normal. The patient's INR remained stable at 1.4 and subdural drain was removed. Post drain pull CT was stable.  

On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically stable. Repeat CT was stable. The patient completed his third dose of Vitamin K and INR remained stable at 1.4. Per hematology recommendations, subcutaneous heparin was restarted for DVT prophylaxis. His activity restriction was lifted and he was evaluated by physical therapy.

On ___ the patient remained neurologically stable. The patient worked with physical therapy and occupational therapy who recommended one more visit with the patient prior to discharge. His morning INR was 1.3. Hematology was notified and stated the patient would be called with a follow up appointment in ___ weeks. He complained of burning on urination and abdominal pain. A UA/UC was sent and he was started on Bactrim for UTI. He failed void trials x2 and a foley catheter was placed for urinary retention. 

On ___, his neurological exam remained intact. He was changed from step-down to floor status. The urine culture is pending and he continues on Bactrim. He did a foley clamping trial in the morning and felt an urge to void. He was bladder scanned for 400cc so the foley was removed and patient was able to void approximately 200cc. His PVR was about 200cc. He states he has had urinary retention for many years and sees a urologist who manages his BPH with his home meds Tamsulosin and Doxazosin which he is currently taking. He was advised to follow up with his urologist as needed after discharge. His family is at bedside and has been updated on and agree with the discharge plan to home with ___, OT and nursing services.

 Discharge Instructions: Surgery You underwent a surgery called a craniotomy to have blood removed from your brain. Please keep your staples along your incision dry until they are removed. It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to cover it when outside. Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment. You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. ___ try to do too much all at once. No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT allowed to drive by law. No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. You may discuss resuming your Aspirin 81mg at your follow-up appointment. You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is important that you take this medication consistently and on time. You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience: You may have difficulty paying attention, concentrating, and remembering new information. Emotional and/or behavioral difficulties are common. Feeling more tired, restlessness, irritability, and mood swings are also common. You may also experience some post-operative swelling around your face and eyes.

The swelling will be its worse in the morning after laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be easier during this time. Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener. Headaches: Headache is one of the most common symptoms after a brain bleed. Most headaches are not dangerous but you should call your doctor if the headache gets worse, develop arm or leg weakness, increased sleepiness, and/or have nausea or vomiting with a headache. Mild pain medications may be helpful with these headaches but avoid taking pain medications on a daily basis unless prescribed by your doctor. There are other things that can be done to help with your headaches: avoid caffeine, get enough sleep, daily exercise, relaxation/ meditation, massage, acupuncture, heat or ice packs.
