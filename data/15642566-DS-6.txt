Left internal carotid artery show no significant stenosis; dissection or thrombosis. By NASCET criteria, there is no significant stenosis of the both ICA and.  At included intracranial components of both ICA show moderate-to-severe calcified atherosclerotic plaques with about 50% luminal narrowing at supraclinoid ICA bilaterally.  Background of moderate noncalcified atherosclerotic changes affecting both cervical and included intracranial vertebral arteries with no significant stenosis, dissection or occlusion. Hypoplastic left vertebral artery as normal variant.  Increased atlantodental interval measuring 8 mm is suggestive of transverse ligament disruption. There is a hyperdensity posterior to the dens abutting the spinal cord is concerning for epidural hematoma (02:147).  Right C5-C7 transverse process fractures are present, but do not appear to extend through the transverse foramina (2:104, 95, and 83). There is a trace left apical pneumothorax. There is trace pneumomediastinum. Subcutaneous mphysema and hematoma is noted along the left anterior chest wall. Small bilateral pleural effusions/hematoma are present. Ground-glass appearance of the lungs could be related to expiratory phase versus pulmonary edema. Additional thoracic findings dictated in the separate chest CT report.   IMPRESSION:  1.

Moderate-sized dorsal calcaneal spur. Mild-to-moderate degenerative spurring in the midfoot. Soft tissue swelling is noted overlying the ventral aspect of the distal tibia.   IMPRESSION:   No acute fracture or dislocation. 

LEFT KNEE AND TIB/FIB XRAY ___ FINDINGS:   No acute fracture or dislocation. Severe degenerative changes of the left knee are most pronounced in the patellofemoral and medial compartments with bone-on-bone articulation, large osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. A large joint effusion is present. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormality. Additionally, marked soft tissue swelling is noted ventral and medial to the mid tibia.   IMPRESSION:    1. No acute fracture or dislocation. 2. Large suprapatellar joint effusion and marked soft tissue swelling overlying the ventral and medial aspect of the mid tibia. 3. Severe degenerative changes of the left knee. 

___ SPLENIC EMBOLIZATION FINDINGS:   1. Celiac arteriogram demonstrates no focus of extravasation overlying the left upper quadrant. 2. Selective splenic arteriogram demonstrates no extravasation from the main splenic artery, any of the branches arising from the splenic artery, or on delayed filling, from the splenic vein in the site noted on CTA.  No pseudoaneurysm. 3. Selective GDA arteriogram demonstrates no sites of extravasation pseudoaneurysm arising from the GDA territory, including the right gastroepiploic artery, which is well seen. 4. SMA arteriogram demonstrates no focus of extravasation, pseudoaneurysm, or arterial irregularity.   IMPRESSION:   Detailed angiography of celiac, splenic, GDA/right gastroepiploic artery, and SMA demonstrate no focus of extravasation or pseudoaneurysm within the left upper quadrant. 

MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST FINDINGS:   There is widening of the atlantodental interval to 6 mm, unchanged from CT cervical spine obtained 10 hours prior in a similar measurement.  There is T1 hypointense, mixed T2 hypo/hyper, and stir heterogeneous signal around the atlanto-dental interval and extending posteriorly to the dens, likely representing posttraumatic edema on a background of chronic degenerative change and possible pannus formation. There is a subchondral cyst in the posterior dens (3:9). There is trace prevertebral edema at C2-C3. There is also edema underlying the alar ligament superior to the dens, and along the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2 (3:9). There is no definite disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament.   Right-sided C5 through C7 transverse process fractures are better evaluated on prior CT. There is minimal anterolisthesis of C3 on C4. There is small scattered areas of focal fat, otherwise marrow signal is within normal limits.   The visualized portion of the spinal cord is preserved in signal and caliber.  Apparent linear increased STIR signal at C3-4 and C4-5 is most consistent with artifact.   Intervertebral discheightsare narrowed at multiple levels and there is signal change consistent with multilevel disc desiccation.   At C2-3 there is no vertebral canalnarrowing but uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet osteophytes causing moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing.   At C3-4 there is disc bulge with mildvertebral canaland uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet osteophytes causing severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing..   At C4-5 there is a posterior disc osteophytes and disc bulge, causing effacement of the CSF space and severe vertebral canal narrowing. There is uncovertebral hypertrophy causing severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing..   At C5-6 there is disc bulge with moderate to severevertebral canaland uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy causing severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing..   At C6-7 there is disc protrusion with mild to moderatevertebral canal narrowingand uncovertebral hypertrophy causing severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing..   At C7-T1 there is disc bulge, facet hypertrophy, and ligamentum flavum thickening causing mild vertebral canal narrowing and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing..   OTHER: Within the limits of this noncontrast study there is no evidence of infection or neoplasm. The visualized portion of the posterior fossa, cervicomedullary junction, paranasal sinuses and lung apicesare preserved.   IMPRESSION:    1. Unchanged widening of the atlantodental interval at 6 mm compared to prior CT cervical spine from 10 hours prior. Signal changes at the craniocervical junction, as above, likely represent a combination of posttraumatic edema about the dens and prevertebral space, on a background of chronic degenerative change and pannus formation. 2. Edema underlying the alar ligament and posterior longitudinal ligament at C2 without definite ligamentous disruption. 3. Moderate to severe degenerative change in the cervical spine most severe at C4-5 and C5-6, as above. 4. Please refer to recent CT cervical spine for better visualization of right-sided C5 through C7 transverse process fractures. 

LEFT WRIST XRAY ___ FINDINGS:   There is a partially visualized displaced fracture of the third metacarpal.  There is no fracture or dislocation of the radius or ulna.  There are degenerative changes about the first CMC. Carpal bones are well aligned.  There are densities within the soft tissues of the forearm which likely represent dystrophic calcifications.   IMPRESSION:   1. Displaced fracture of the base of the third metatarsal. 2. Moderate osteoarthritis of the first CMC joint.   RECOMMENDATION(S): Dedicated radiographs of the left hand are recommended to further evaluate the third metacarpal fracture and to assess for other bony abnormality. 

LEFT HAND XRAY ___ IMPRESSION:   There is an oblique fracture of the proximal half of the third metacarpal. Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the first CMC joint. 

___ CTA CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS FINDINGS:   LOWER CHEST: Large bilateral pleural effusions, larger than in prior studies, associated to compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes. Stable cardiomegaly.   ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:   Hepatobiliary: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.   Pancreas: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.   Spleen: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Between the splenic hilum in the greater curvature of the stomach there is a hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation, more organized as compared to prior study and relatively unchanged in size measuring 6.0 x 4.1 cm.   Adrenals: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.   Urinary: The kidneys are normal and symmetric in size with normal nephrogram. Focal cortical defect noted in the inferior pole of the right kidney (303:78), likely sequela from prior infection. There is no perinephric abnormality.   Gastrointestinal: The stomach is unremarkable. The visualized segments of small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout.Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening and fat stranding.   Lymph Nodes: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.   Vascular: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.   Bones: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or new fracture.  Multiple left rib fractures are re-visualized.   Soft Tissues: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.   IMPRESSION:    1. Mesenteric hematoma seen between the greater curvature of the stomach in the splenic hilum, relatively unchanged in size with a more organized appearance as compared to prior study from ___. There is no evidence of active extravasation. 2. Interval increase in size of the bilateral pleural effusions, which appear nonhemorrhagic. 

___ CHEST XRAY FINDINGS:   There is no definite pneumothorax on the right or the left. The previously seen multiple rib fractures are re-demonstrated. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There is worsening pulmonary vascular congestion compared to prior study on ___. There is increased density of the right lower lobe, which is likely consistent with superimposed right-sided pleural effusion. There is no definite pneumonia, although evaluation is limited. The right PICC line is seated within the mid-SVC.   IMPRESSION:   1. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion.  2. Increased right pleural effusion. 

___ ABDOMINAL XRAY FINDINGS:   There are distended loops of large bowel without evidence of small bowel for large bowel obstruction. There are no pathologically dilated loops of bowel.   Free intraperitoneal air is better assessed with an upright radiograph however on the supine film there is no large volume free intraperitoneal air.   Osseous structures are notable for left eighth, ninth, and tenth rib fractures.  There is chondrocalcinosis of the costal cartilage.   There are multiple rounded radiopacities within the left lower pelvis which appear stable in appearance from prior. These may reflect a calcified component of a teratoma given the left adnexal mass seen on recent CT of the pelvis.   There is blunting of the left and right costophrenic angles with a left sided pleural effusion. The stability of this finding would be better visualized with a chest radiograph.   IMPRESSION:    1. No pathologically dilated loops of bowel to suggest obstruction or ileus. 2. Multiple left-sided rib fractures. 3. Calcific density within the left lower pelvis likely reflects calcified components of a teratoma in the setting of the left adnexal mass seen on recent CT from ___

Due to concern for splenic hemorrhage her Pradaxa was reversed with idarucizumab and she had angiography which did not identify any active extravasation. Her fractures were managed nonoperatively and she was placed in ___ c-collar as well as left volar splint on the wrist. Due to hyponatremia and dyspnea, she was transferred to the medicine service where it was determined this was most likely due to iatrogenic fluid overload. These issues both resolved with holding IV fluids and resumption of home torsemide. She had a UTI treated with 3 days of nitrofurantoin.  She was discharged to rehab facility with orthospine, hand surgery, and new cardiology follow-up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] Nonweightbearing left upper extremity, activities of daily living as tolerated, patient may range the digits gently as well as the thumb. Continue volar splint until follow-up.

[] Follow up in ortho spine fellow clinic in ___ weeks for radiographic and clinical re-evaluation.

[] Patient connected with cardiologist on discharge. Consider just continuation of trend in favor of DOAC as well as discontinuation of digoxin if feasible. Consider outpatient TTE to assess global systolic function as well as etiology of atrial fibrillation.

[] Mildly elevated TSH of 12 identified on evaluation of hyponatremia, recommend following up with PCP ___ 4 to 6 weeks for further evaluation. She was not started on thyroid replacement.

[] Patient received antibiotics from ___ to ___ (ceftriaxone and nitrofurantoin).

[] Patient noted to have mildly elevated white count throughout her stay. Is also noted that her baseline was mildly above normal based on prior labs. Recommend checking CBC as an outpatient to ensure resolution.

[] Follow-up with oncologist at ___ as needed for management of recently diagnosed breast cancer.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Motor vehicle collision # C1-C2 ligamentous injury # Transverse C5-C7 fractures # Concern for splenic hemorrhage # Left ___ metacarpal fracture Ms. ___ is an ___ s/p MVC, transferred from outside hospital with multiple bilateral rib fractures, Right hemothorax, pneumomediastinum, left upper quadrant extravasation status post non-therapeutic ___ angiography (no active extravasation was seen), C1-C2 ligamentous injury with possible epidural hematoma, no vertebral artery injury. MRI cervical spine confirmed no epidural hematoma. Has history of atrial fibrillation on dabigatran (was reversed with Praxbind), and recent diagnosis of breast cancer. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for frequent neurological monitoring, hematocrit checks, pain control, and close monitoring. Orthopedic spine was consulted and recommended hard cervical spine collar and outpatient follow up.

On HD2 the patient underwent xrays of the left wrist and was found to have an oblique fracture of the proximal half of the third metacarpal. Hand surgery was consulted and a left Volar splint was placed. The patient had a PICC line placed due to poor venous access for lab draws. Pain was controlled with dilaudid PCA and Tylenol. She was given 1 unit packed red blood cells on ___ for hematocrit of 21 with active bleeding seen on CTA but negative angiogram and post transfusion hematocrit was 25.5.

On HD3 the patient required supplemental oxygenation with nasal cannula. She ws encouraged to use incentive spirometer. Foley catheter was removed and she voided spontaneously. Chronic atrial fibrillation was rate controlled on home diltiazem and digoxin. She was started on heparin subcu BID for VTE prophylaxis. Pradaxa was held in setting of concern for continued bleeding. On HD4 the patient remained hemodyanmivally stable and was transferred to the surgical floor for ongoing monitoring. On HD5 the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.5 and post transfusion hematocrit was 26.8. On HD7 hematocrit remained stable and therefore the patient was started on a heparin drip for afib. On HD9 the patient became short of breath over night and chest xray showed pulmonary edema. The patient was given 5 mg IV Lasix and home torsimide was restarted. Her respiratory status improved and she was able to be weaned to room air. The patient had persistent Hyponatremia that did not respond to fluid restriction. On HD8 the medical service was consulted for assistance in managing fluid status in setting of hyponatremia in a medically complex patient with CHF and CAD. 

#Hyponatremia During her time of the surgical service, the patient developed mild hyponatremia to 128. This is likely due to fluid overload in the setting of trauma and a mild SIADH. On transfer to the medical service, IV fluids were held and her home torsemide was resumed. Her sodium slowly improved to 134 on discharge. On review of ___ chart, her baseline sodium is on the low end of normal (low 130s).

#Dyspnea Patient briefly required supplemental oxygen with NC. Etiology was thought due to fluid overload from continuous IV fluids.  Her home diuretic was restarted and she was quickly weaned to room air.

# Atrial fibrillation CHADSVASC 4. Has taken dabigatran and digoxin for the past decade as this was prescribed by her prior doctor in ___ per ___ she has not established care with a cardiologist here as of yet. On admission due to trauma, anticoagulation was held. As noted above, due to concern for hemorrhage her dabigatran was reversed with idarucizumab and she underwent angiography which did not identify any source of active extravasation. She was restarted on heparin drip once stabilized and switched back to home dabigatran shortly thereafter. Her home rate control with diltiazem and digoxin was resumed.

# Epigastric pain (resolved) EKG without concern for ischemia. Normal LFTs/lipase. AXR showing no concern for free air or ileus. Resolved spontaneously.

# E. coli UTI Patient asymptomatic, found incidentally on UA performed for hyponatremia work-up. Status post 3-day ceftriaxone course, then urine cultures growing resistant E. coli so switched to Macrobid on ___. Course completed ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #Chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Home torsemide initially held in setting of trauma, resumed later in the hospital course.

#Breast cancer Patient recently diagnosed with breast cancer, followed at ___ ___. Home anastrozole was initially held, and restarted once patient stabilized.

RIB FRACTURES: * Your injury caused left and right sided rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.  * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.  * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs.  * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.  * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain.  * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.  * Do NOT smoke  * If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves.  * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs (crepitus).
