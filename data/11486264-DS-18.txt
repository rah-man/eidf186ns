However, in RLE, ___ in TA, ___ in ___ and ___ in gastrocnemius, otherwise strength intact SENSORY - intact to LT GAIT - deferred, as pt bedbound currently  Pertinent Results: CT STEREOTACTIC BIOPSY FINDINGS: Comparison is made with the ___ enhanced cranial MR, dated ___, uploaded to PACS.   There is a hypodense mass centered in the right temporal lobe with peripheral enhancement, measuring approximately 41 x 41 mm. Two satellite lesions are seen in the anterior-inferior right temporal lobe. There is surrounding vasogenic edema extending superiorly. There is 5 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage although evaluation is slightly limited in the setting of administration of intravenous contrast. Limited evaluation of intracranial vessels demonstrates no acute abnormality. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated. 

  IMPRESSION: 4 cm peripherally enhancing mass centered in the right temporal lobe with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and 5 mm leftward shift of normally- midline structures, improved from the OSH study. 

CT HEAD POST-OP ___: IMPRESSION: Right temporoparietal mass, as seen previously, with expected post-operative changes, s/p biopsy via right parietal burr hole.

The procedure went well but afterwards he experienced a brief episode of hypotension. The medicine service was consulted and it was determined that this episode was likely due to the anesthesia.
