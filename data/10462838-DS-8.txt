UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins. 

ULTRASOUND KNEE: Thickened edematous soft tissue over the suprapatellar right knee without evidence of fluid collection or joint effusion.   FOOT X-RAY: In comparison with the study of ___, there again is severe degenerative change with narrowing and spurring involving the first metatarsophalangeal joint. There is been a dramatic increase in soft tissue swelling dorsally at the level of the metatarsals, consistent with the clinical history of recurrent cellulitis. However, there is no definite evidence of bone destruction, or gas or opaque foreign body in soft tissues.  Nevertheless, if there is strong clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis, MRI could be obtained. Postsurgical changes are again seen in the calcaneus posteriorly.

# RLE cellulitis / question suprapatellar bursitis: No prior micro data to guide treatment. Has previously responded well to gram positive coverage, and most recently was discharged on cephalexin. There was concern during his last hospitalization about small foreign body seen on foot xray, although this was involving his LLE. Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT. There was an area of induration above the knee, but ultrasound showed no significant fluid collection. Appears to have changes consistent with chronic venous stasis and a small dry ulcer on his ___ toe on the right, which likely predisposed him to infection. He was evaluated by podiatry who recommended betadine dressing changes and outpatient follow-up. Patient improved significantly with IV vancomycin, and was transitioned to clindamycin to complete a 7 day course. Other than mild leukocytosis, he demonstrated no signs of systemic infection.
