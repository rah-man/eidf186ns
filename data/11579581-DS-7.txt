 Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: ___ 01:30PM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-4.12* Hgb-13.2 Hct-39.1 MCV-95 MCH-32.0 MCHC-33.8 RDW-12.2 Plt ___ ___ 01:30PM BLOOD Neuts-66.7 ___ Monos-9.3 Eos-0.6 Baso-0.2 ___ 01:30PM BLOOD UreaN-10 Creat-0.5 Na-138 K-3.3 Cl-96 HCO3-30 AnGap-15 ___ 01:30PM BLOOD ALT-16 AST-27 AlkPhos-64 TotBili-0.6 ___ 01:30PM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Mg-2.0 . CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumonia. . MRI Brain ___: Finding most suspicious for marked interval progression of left frontal glioblastoma, with findings concerning for subependymal spread into the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle as well. While less likely given the history, infection could have similar appearance. . EEG ___: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of frequent high amplitude spike and wave discharges in the left frontal region, at times spreading to the left frontal temporal region, phase reversing at F3 and F7, indicative of a highly epileptogenic region. At times, the discharges were periodic at 1 Hz, although they did not evolve in frequency or amplitude, to suggest ongoing electrographic seizures. However, periodic discharges are considered to be on the ictal-interictal continuum and may cause mental status changes or neurologic deficits. Thus, clinical correlation is recommended. Focal slowing indicative of subcortical dysfuntion, along with a breach rhythm were seen in the same region, most likely due to a skull defect. 

Otherwise, the waking background was slightly disorganized but did reach a maximum of 8.5 Hz posteriorly. . EEG ___: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of frequent epileptiform discharges seen in the left frontal temporal region phase reversing at F3 and F7. However, these discharges did not evolve in amplitude or frequency to suggest ongoing seizure activity. Overall, the discharges appeared less frequent compared to the previous days' recordings. Focal slowing was also seen in the left frontal temporal regions indicative of subcortical dysfunction. The higher amplitude activity with superimposed fast activity in the same region indicates a breach rhythm seen with skull defects. Although the waking background reached a maximum of 8 Hz posteriorly, it was slightly disorganized and occasional bursts of generalized slowing was seen. Together, these findings indicate a mild encephalopathy. . EEG ___: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of 

epileptiform discharges in the left frontal temporal region, indicative of highly epileptogenic cortext in this region. In the same area, focal slowing was seen, indicative of subcortical dysfunction in this region. A breach rhythm due to skull defect was again seen in the same location. The bursts of generalized slowing indicate subcortical dysfunction or dysfunction of the deep midline structures. Otherwise, the waking background did reach a maximum of 9 Hz posteriorly. 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F with temporal GBM ___ weeks of unsteadiness shaking at home and an episode of hematochezia. . # Weakness, falls: Likley ___ progression of her disease seen on MRI. Infectious was done, CXR unremarkable, BCx NGTD, UCx negative, and C diff negative. EEG with seizure activity, so pt was placed on video monitoring for approximately 36 hours. Keppra was increased to 1500 BID. She was placed on dexamethasone with PPI prophylaxsis. After discussion between the patient's family and Dr. ___ decision was made to start Avastin. She recieved the first dose prior to discharge. given persistant activity on EEG, Depaoke was added to her AED regimen. She recieved a loading dose prior to discharge.   .  # Hematochezia: New per report. Pt had normal stools here which were guiac negative. No further workup was initiated. . Code status was discuss with the patient and husband in admission and was confirmed full code.  Medications on Admission: -levetiracetam [Keppra] 500 mg Tablet 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  -ondansetron HCl 8 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth ever 8 hours as needed for nausea (per pt, only takes when she's taking the chemo)  -temozolomide [___] 250 mg Capsule 1 Capsule(s) by mouth daily for 5 days
