Chief Complaint: ___ weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___: Posterior C4-6 laminectomies, C3-7 PISF

 History of Present Illness: ___ year-old right-handed ___ man with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cervical spondylosis with myelopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and alcohol abuse who was admitted last evening with progressively worsening weakness and numbness over the last 2 weeks prior to admission.

Per his daughter's report (serving as ___), the patient first had difficulty standing approximately one year ago, at a time when he was hospitalized for vascular disease of the lower extremities. The patient and family report that these were "clots," however, he was apparently assessed by vascular surgery and was never started on anticoagulation. It does appear that he underwent left SFA angioplasty and stenting at ___ in ___. The patient reports that the weakness was most pronounced in the distal lower extremities at that time, though he was still able to walk independently and without falling.  The weakness persisted for ~ 3 weeks after the hospitalization, but it gradually resolved and his strength apparently returned to baseline. He could walk distances without limitation.

Eight months ago, the patient first noted numbness in his feet that has gradually progressed upwards to his hips bilaterally. Approximately 6 months ago, he was admitted to the hospital again for hypertension and back pain. The exact nature of the back pain is unclear, though the patient states that it was in the lower spine, indicating the lumbosacral region when asked. He apparently underwent a lumbar puncture, but he and his daughter are unsure of its exact nature or the results. They do state that he was started on a medication at that time, though they are not clear if these were antimicrobials. After discharge, his daughter notes that he could no longer stand for any prolonged period, such as to shower or shave. He was able to walk from room-to-room in the house with help of a cane, but not further distances. By one report, he began to have worsening dyspnea on exertion at this time (progressively worsening to a distance of even ___ feet), though the patient denies dyspnea in this interview.

His daughter states that his strength as well as his ability to stand and walk improved somewhat over the next five months until ___ weekend, though he never returned to his baseline one year ago. On ___, his daughter notes that she had to help him off the toilet when he could not stand on his own. She was able to walk him to the bedroom, only holding his hand for guidance. However, she states that his legs seemed to buckle at the knees "stiff below the waist." He fell on his buttocks, but did not hit his head. Over the next week, he simply slid from the bed to the floor whenever he attempted to stand up. He relied on a wheelchair, according to his daughter. 

He has had no bowel or bladder dysfunction of any kind. The patient reports that his right leg is weaker than his left. His also has had difficulty gripping items in his hands. He has some lower back pain, but states that it has been "improving."

He had a complete neurologic evaluation including an MRI of his cervical spine showing severe stenosis with cord signal changes and evidence of cord compression. He denied bowel and bladder symptoms, but did have weakness in both hisupper and lower extremities and was unable to ambulate independently. These symptoms progressed in the few weeks prior to admission. Denies distal numbness or tingling. He was cleared by the medical service for surgical decompression and fusion, but is on Plavix at baseline. The Plavix was stopped a few days after admission once the MRI results returned, and the patient's exam remained stable as he was off Plavix for 4 days prior to the OR. On ___, he was taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure performed by Dr. ___. Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. Diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#2. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Post-operatively, he was transferred to the ortho spine service and medicine was consulted for management of his ___ hypertension (SBPs into the 200s despite his home regimen). He was started on Hydralazine PO in addition to Hydralazine IV for breakthrough with moderate control of his pressures. He was then transitioned to PO Labetolol for improved control with SBP into the 160s. Post-operatively, he was noted to have some weakness of left wrist extension and left triceps. He has baseline pre-op L shoulder pain and decreased ROM in addition to some deltoid wasting so some strength testing is painful for the patient. Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
