Today at ___ she was noted to have a fever to 102.7 for which she was transferred to an OSH for further evaluation.

CT Scan Head (second read of OSH CT): ___ 1. No acute intracranial pathology. MRI is recommended for further evaluation of the questionable right parietal infarct given limited sensitivity of CT towards detection of acute infarction. 2. Unchanged chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 

MRI Head ___ 1. No acute infarct or other secondary sign of vasculitis. Please note that the study does not include an MRA and therefore does adequately evaluate the vasculature. However, small vessel disease of any type, including vasculitis, cannot be excluded by MRI or MRA, and cranial MRA would not generally evaluate the branches of the external carotid artery. 2. Abnormal bone marrow signal of the upper cervical spine with an enhancing 5 mm soft tissue mass posterior to the dens, consistent with a rheumatoid pannus. Consider supervised flexion and extension radiography, perhaps under fluoroscopic control, to assess for upper cervical spine instability. 3. Interval development of lacunar infarcts of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in comparison to ___. 

___: Carotid Ultrasound Right ICA with no stenosis . Left ICA with no stenosis . 

___ CT scan abdomen Interval resolution of left liver lobe abscess with drain in appropriate position. No new fluid collections noted.  

___ PATHOLOGY # ___ Temporal artery left. results pending

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgical service on ___ with persistent recurrent headaches, visual changes, and fever from her rehab. Her PICC line was removed and sent for culture (negative). Other culture results were negative as well. Neurology was consulted given her neurologic findings and a question of infarct on her OSH CT. Radiology re-interpreted the CT head and did not feel that there was any acute intracranial pathology. An MRI was ordered to futher follow-up.  This was performed on HD#2 and was negative as well for acute pathology. Infectious disease was consulted who recommended resuming her nafcillin (temporarily had changed to Ceftriaxone).  A course of 4 more weeks will be necessary at her discharge. A repeat CT of her abdomen was performed that showed resolution of her abscess cavity. The abscess drain continued to have no output therefore it was removed on ___. She remained afebrile for her entire hospital course. A PICC was placed on ___ for her antibiotics.

For her continued neurologic symptoms and her temporal headache rheumatology was consulted for a concern of temporal arteritis.  It was recommended to begin prednisone treatment and a temporal artery biopsy was obtained ___. The results of the biopsy are pending at the time of discharge. She will followup with rheumatology in ___ as an outpatient to review the biopsy results and to determine whether steriod therapy is necessary to continue. (see d/c instructions for phone number of clinic).

She was intermittently hypertensive (to a maximum of 210sbp) during this hospitalization. Renal medicine was consulted for changes to her antihypertensive regimen. She was started on norvasc and minoxydil and her atenelol was changed to carvedilol. On the day of discharge her blood pressure was at goal of 140s-150s. If she becomes more hypertensive while at rehab the recommendation is to begin an angiotensin receptor blocker. She should followup with her PCP regarding her blood pressure regimen.

She was tolerating a regular diet and ambulating independently on her discharge. Her neurologic symptoms were resolving at discharge. She needs to followup with her PCP for blood pressure followup, ID (Dr. ___ for her antibiotic followup, Rheumatology for her biopsy results and for management of her prednisone, and Dr. ___ 4weeks with a repeat CT abdomen).  She needs weekly cbc, diff, bun, cr, lfts faxed to Dr. ___ ___ in the ___ clinic at ___.
