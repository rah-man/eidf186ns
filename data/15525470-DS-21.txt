Chief Complaint: Back pain, weakness, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: ___ year old woman with HTN, Graves, chronic back pain, lymphedema, uterine prolapse s/p complicated TAH/BSO in ___ of this year, who presents with weakness, back pain, BRBPR. She was found to have T11 compression fracture as well as LLL opacity, 3 cm, concerning for malignancy. 

History is obtained mostly through chart and ED signout, as pt was not willing kept was hanging up the interpreter phone.

She has had repeat hospital stays this year for fall, weakness, and once for aphasia thought to be due to an episode of hypotension and L M2 stenosis and was found to have punctate ischemic stroke in the L frontal cortex.

History is limited by pt's ability to give chronologic history and interrupted by her current symptoms. 

She has felt overall globally weak since her TAH/BSO, worse in the past week. She denied focal weakness or difficulty accomplishing specific tasks, just an overall sense of feeling tired and like she doesn't have enough strength. Overnight on the ___, she felt so weak that she didn't get out of bed to go to the bathroom. This is what prompted her to come to the ED. She recently complained of DOE at cardiology visit, thought to be due to ? lung disease. 

Her BRBPR is hard to quantify. She doesn't say she has hematochezia, blood in the toilet, with wiping, only that she has seen bright red blood in the stool. Her rectal exam showed no stool in the vault but "guaiac positive gel".

She complained of worsening back pain, and given history of urinary incontinence ( which turned out to be chronic) her entire neuroaxis was imaged which revealed T12 anterior superior corner fracture. She reports a fall when visiting her cardiologist (Dr ___, for which a rapid response was called. She chose not to go to the ED. Orthospine was consulted in the ED, who recommended TLSO brace. 

Her imaging also revealed 3.1 cm peribronchial opacity in LLL c/f malignancy, as it was unchanged from ___ image.

She was started on ceftriaxone for presumed UTI.

In the ED, initial vitals:  T 97.7 HR68 BP130/80 RR18 97% RA Labs were significant for: UA with nitrities, large leuks, and 175 WBC

Cr 1.2 from baseline 0.9 CK: 367 

Imaging of her entire neuroaxis revealed:  T-Spine 1. New T12 anterior superior corner fracture compared to ___ with mild loss of height. No retropulsion. Minimal prevertebral hematoma. 2. 3.1 cm peribronchial opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, solid medial and ground-glass laterally, is unchanged compared to the motion limited ___llowing for differences in technique. Malignancy cannot be excluded. 

L-Spine 1. No evidence for a fracture in the lumbar spine. 2. Multilevel lumbar spine degenerative disc disease. Mild spinal canal narrowing at L3-L4 and L4-L5. Moderate left L3-L4, bilateral L4-L5, and right L5-S1 neural foraminal narrowing. Severe left L5-S1 neural foraminal narrowing. 3. Partially imaged T12 compression fracture is better assessed on the same-day thoracic spine CT. 

C-spine IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly motion limited exam. 2. No evidence for a fracture. No subluxation. 3. Multilevel degenerative disease. 

In the ED, pt received  ___ 15:11 IV CefTRIAXone  ___ 12:26 IV Magnesium Sulfate 2 gm 

Vitals prior to transfer:  HR 62 BP121/59 RR16 99% RA 

On the floor, the patient is interviewed with phone at bedside. She is thankful for the care she has received so far but is tired and does not wish to engage in another interview and repeatedly hangs up the phone. She confirms many aspects of the above story.

#LLL lesion with concern for malignancy. Patient presents with FTT, fatigue, and weakness with CT chest concerning for possible bronchogenic carcinoma without evidence of metastasis at this time. Given location of lesion and concern for high vascularity, ___ requested that her ASA be held for five days (held since ___. ___ to arrange follow-up appointment for biopsy after discharge.

#T11 compression fracture #Osteopenia. New T11 fracture which may occurred after fall, also with report by ___ interpreters, who are familiar with her in the outpatient setting, that she had gotten caught within the revolving doors at her outpatient clinic site (deferred ED evaluation at that time). Evaluated by ___ who recommended that she wear a TLSO brace at all times when out of bed. Patient should follow-up with Dr. ___ in ___ weeks and will require standing AP and lateral films of the T-spine and the L-spine without the brace. At time of discharge, patient refusing to wear TLSO brace and provided with LSO brace however medical recommendations remains TLSO brace to be worn at all times when out of bed. Gabapentin 400mg BID started for pain control.

___. Patient presented with Cr to 1.2 from baseline 0.8-0.9, which was likely due to pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor po intake, improved with IVF. 

#HTN. Patient is unable to reliably recount her medications but per ___, she is on Irbesartan. Given ___, Irbesartan was held initially and restarted at 150mg daily.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,

You were evaluated at ___ after presenting with back pain and fatigue. You were found to have a fracture in your back which will require that you wear a brace whenever you are out of bed until you follow-up with the Neurosurgery team. You worked with physical therapy who feel that rehab will help you to become stronger. 

You were also found to have a urinary tract infection for which you received antibiotics.

On one of your imaging scans, you were noted to have a lesion in the left lung that is concerning for cancer. The next step is to have this lesion sampled to determine if it is cancer. You will need to follow-up with the Interventional Radiology team for biopsy which has been arranged below.

We recommend that you wear the TLSO brace every time you are out of bed.

It is very important that you take your medications as prescribed and attend your follow-up appointments as listed below.

We wish you the best!

Your ___ Team  Followup Instructions: ___
