 History of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ yo RH M with h/o cervical radiculopathy s/p C3-C7 laminectomy (___) who presents with a one week history of falls and worsening gait in the setting of a URI. 

Patient's problems began 9 days ago on ___, when he became acutely dizzy (vertiginous without nausea) when walking home from a function at ___. Episode lasted ___ minutes, leaned on a tree to rest. Prior to this he was at baseline and walking normally. 

On ___, he developed a cough and fatigue and purchased some OTC meds (including guaifenesin) which helped his symptoms, but by ___ his symptoms had worsened with generalized weakness, nausea, and anorexia. He presented to his PCP who ordered CXR to R/O PNA (normal) and administered 1L IV NS as he was objectively dehydrated and felt earlier sx may have been ___ orthostatic hypotension. He was told to hold his HCTZ/losartan for a few days. 

Starting on ___, patient began to experience falls. He noted that his first fall (and all subsequent ones) felt as though his right leg "gave out" underneath him, rather than tripping over his own feet. Not preceded by dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness. Not associated with back or leg pain. He states he sometimes felt like "I have to keep walking because if I stop, I will fall". Over the course of the next 3 days through ___, he had a total of 6 falls, with 2 on ___ (no LOC or head injuries). He thus presented to the ___ ED for evaluation. 

At ___ ED, patient underwent MRI T/L spine which showed severe degenerative changes of L spine (mostly below where cord ends). Also showed some disk impingement on T spine around T9-10. C-spine MRI obtained per Neuro recs showed disk bulges at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with signal changes in the cord consistent with myelomalacia. Orthostatics were checked and found WNL. Has undergone peripheral neuropathy workup (B12, TSH, RPR) all of which have been WNL. His gait has remained stably poor per primary team, although patient states that overall it has been gradually worsening since onset of symptoms one week ago. 

Of note, at baseline patient states he is very active, runs and works out at the gym 3 times per week. Since his gait problems started, he has not left his home for the past week for fear of falling. He walks at home by holding onto furniture. The onset was gradual and the gait difficulty has been progressive. No clear change in bowel pattern, although his urination volume may have been lower. No urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia or incontinence. No acute injuries to his neck or back. He has been feeling week in general in the past week due to a viral illness which is still ongoing. 

On neuro ROS, patient endorses intermittent RLE weakness per above. He denies numbness or parasthesia. Occasionally he endorses back pain but only mild. Endorses chronic constipation, denies acute bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general ROS, patient endorses cough, generalized fatigue and nausea per above. Endorses unintentional 9 lb weight loss over the past 6 months. Denies fever or chills, night sweats.

PERTINENT LABS: -___-___* -TSH-3.7 -T4-6.4 -b2micro-2.5* -SPEP-NO SPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES -UPEP- ****

CXR (___): The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

EMG (___): Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic evidence is most consistent with mild, chronic cervical and lumbosacral polyradiculopathies on the right. The reduced activation on needle electromyography suggests that a central process is contributing to this patient's lower extremity weakness. A mild underlying sensorimotor polyneuropathy with some demyelinating features also cannot be excluded.  In the absence of fibrillation or fasciculation potentials, the findings do not support a generalized disorder of motor neurons or their axons, as would be seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

MRI T/L SPINE (___): Evaluation of the thoracic spine demonstrates small right paracentral disc protrusion at T7-T8 and a diffuse disc bulge at T9-T10. There is a significant pulsation artifact posterior to the thoracic cord which limits evaluation for subtle hematomas. There is no abnormal marrow signal in the thoracic spine.  Evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates degenerative endplate changes at L4-L5. The conus appears unremarkable. Axial images at T12-L1 demonstrate diffuse disc bulge without significant stenosis.  At L1-L2, there is a diffuse disc bulge with moderate central canal stenosis and moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing with possible impingement of the right exiting nerve root.  At L2-L3, there is a diffuse disc bulge with a more focal component in the left lateral recess with moderate-to-severe central and left lateral recess narrowing. There is bilateral facet DJD. There is mild foraminal narrowing on the left.  There is a moderate foraminal narrowing on the right.  At L3-L4, there is a diffuse disc bulge and bilateral facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy with mild central stenosis and moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.  At L4-L5, there is a diffuse disc bulge extending to lateral recess bilaterally with severe central stenosis and severe right and moderate left foraminal narrowing. There is moderate to severe bilateral facet DJD.  At L5-S1, there is a diffuse disc bulge contacting both S1 nerve roots. There is otherwise no significant central stenosis. The foramina are patent.  Incidentally noted are large bilateral renal cysts.  IMPRESSION: Extensive degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. 

Mild DJD in the thoracic spine. Please see above for details.

MRI C-SPINE W/WO GAD (___): There is severe degenerative disease throughout the cervical spine, with moderate loss of disc height, disc desiccation, and ___ 2 endplate changes at C3-4, C4-C5, and C6-C7. Changes of multilevel cervical laminectomy from C3-C7, with magnetic susceptibility artifact, soft tissue irregularity, edema, and enhancement. No postoperative fluid collections. Diffuse cervical myelomalacia is present, with an atrophic and flattened cord, and focal increased central T2 signal at the C4-5 level.  At C2-3, there is a focal posterior disc protrusion that does not contact the thecal sac. Mild facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy.  At C3-4, there is a broad-based posterior disc/osteophyte complex that effaces the ventral thecal sac. The dorsal CSF space is preserved. Mild facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy.  From C4-C5 through C6-C7, broad-based disc-osteophyte complexes do not contact the thecal sac. Mild facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy.  From C7-T1-T2-T3, the spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.   Major cervical flow voids are preserved.   IMPRESSION: Severe multilevel degenerative disease and chronic myelomalacia. C3-7 cervical laminectomy, without acute cord compression.  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ yo RH M (poor historian) with h/o cervical radiculopathy s/p C3-C7 laminectomy (___), hypothyroidism and anemia who presented with worsening gait over the past week (6 falls in past 2 days) in the setting of recent URI. 

# NEURO: In the ED, patient had MRI T/L/C spine which revealed extensive degenerative changes in the L spine and severe multilevel degenerative disease and chronic myelomalacia in the C-spine. He was initially admitted to Medicine where he was treated for orthostatic hypotension (thought contributing to his increased falls) and had negative peripheral neuropathy workup. Seen by Ortho Spine who recommended non-urgent lumbar laminectomy. On HD #3 he was re-examined by Neurology consult service who noted he had a severely spastic gait, increased tone (legs>arms) and hyper-reflexia throught (legs>arms, right>left). For further workup he was transferred to Neurology service. On HD #4 he underwent EMG to rule out motor neuron disease, as some lower motor neuron pattern weakness was noticed on exam. EMG revealed mild chronic cervical and lumbosacral polyradiculopathies on the right, likely a central process, unlikely lower motor neuron disease. Regarding potential surgery, ultimate decision was to redress the issue after a stint of rehabilitation. Also the patient was recommended to wear a soft collar for cervical spine therapy at least during sleep. His discharge neurological examination demonstrated improved strength of his IP's. 

# LEUKOCYTOSIS: On admission had leukocytosis to 13.8 with left shift, afebrile. Thought related to stress vs. recent URI as UA and CXR were negative. WBC was trended and on day of discharge had decreased likely in association with resolution of his URI.

# CONSTIPATION: C/O constipation on admission (last BM 5 days prior to admission), no urine incontinence/retention or fecal incontinence or saddle anesthesia. Treated with colace, senna and miralax. 

# HTN: continued home nifedipine 90mg daily and losartan-HCTZ 100/12.5mg daily. 

# ANEMIA: baseline HCT 38, stable throughout hospitalization.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___. You came to the hospital because you fell 6 times in the past 2 days. We performed imaging of your spine which showed spinal stenosis which may be contributing to your falls. You also had a CT scan of your head which was normal. You were seen by neurology and spine surgery. Dr. ___ spine surgery felt that you will likely need a laminectomy of the lumbar spine in the near future but did not want to proceed now as you are recovering from an upper respiratory tract infection. You will need to follow up with him soon as below. If your symptoms worsen, please call him right away as you may need more urgent surgery. You are being discharged to rehab to help with your recovery.  Followup Instructions: ___
