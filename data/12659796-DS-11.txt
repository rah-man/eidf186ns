Neurological Examination: Her ___ Performance Score is 70. She is awake, alert, and oriented times 3. There is no right-left confusion or finger agnosia. Calculation is intact. Her language is fluent with good comprehension, naming, and repetition. Her recent recall is good. Cranial Nerve Examination: Her pupils are equal and reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally. Extraocular movements are full. Visual fields are full to confrontation. Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally. Her face is symmetric. Facial sensation is intact bilaterally. Her hearing is intact bilaterally. Her tongue is midline. Palate goes up in the midline. Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong. Motor Examination: She has a slight drift in the left upper extremity. Her muscle strengths are ___ at all muscle groups. Her muscle tone is normal. Her reflexes are ___ and symmetric bilaterally at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knees, and ankles. Her toes are downgoing. Sensory examination is intact to touch but proprioception is impaired in the left great toe. Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria but the left upper extremity has decreased rapid alternating movements. Her gait is normal. She can do tandem and she does not have a Romberg.  Pertinent Results: MRI HISTORY: Dysmetria and unsteady gait. Is there evidence of a cerebellar abnormality?

Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin-echo imaging was performed through the brain. Three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA was performed through the brain. After administration of gadolinium intravenous contrast, gradient-echo, FLAIR, long TR, long TE fast spin-echo, and short TR, short TE spin-echo in three orientations were obtained through the brain. Diffusion imaging was also performed. No prior brain imaging studies are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: There are innumerable enhancing lesions throughout both cerebral hemispheres. The largest of these, in the right occipital lobe, measures approximately 4 cm in diameter and is associated with extensive surrounding edema. The other lesions have variable amounts of edema. The right occipital edema extends into the posterior temporal lobe and into the corpus callosum. This produces mass effect on the lateral ventricles and mild right-to-left midline shift. There are several areas of hypointensity in this largest lesion on the gradient-echo images. These findings suggest the possibility of hemorrhage within the lesion, although calcification is an alternate possibility. The numerous smaller lesions raise the possibility that some may be on the pial surface and perhaps reflect leptomeningeal infiltration. The largest lesion and many of the smaller lesions have areas of central hypointensity after contrast suggesting necrosis. Altogether, these findings most likely represent metastatic disease.

An MRA was performed. This demonstrates a 12-mm aneurysm extending laterally from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery near the origin of the posterior communicating artery. There are no MR findings to suggest hemorrhage associated with this aneurysm.

There is apparent narrowing of the mid basilar artery on this examination. However, this appears most likely to be an MR artifact. If further evaluation of this is indicated and the patient does not undergo a catheter arteriogram for evaluation of the carotid aneurysm, then a repeat MRA or a CTA may be helpful.

These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ at 10:20 a.m. on ___.

CONCLUSION: Probable metastatic disease with innumerable enhancing lesions, many of which are necrotic, throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres.Probable leptomeningeal spread of tumor. Possible hemorrhage within the largest right occipital lesion. Mass effect and midline shift associated with the occipital lesion. 12-mm left posterior communicating artery origin aneurysm.

CHEST: Thyroid is normal in appearance. There are diffuse punctate miliary lesions seen throughout the lungs bilaterally, with several scattered larger semisolid nodules, the largest seen in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 11 x 13 mm along the lateral pleura (image 31). Dystrophic calcification and soft tissue nodular density is seen within the right middle lobe along the mediastinal surface. In the prevascular and left suprahilar region, there are lobulated low-attenuation nodes which exert mass effect on the transiting left superior pulmonary vein and extend along the bronchovascular bundle, similar but much smaller lesions are seen in the left hilar location. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. No focal airspace consolidation; however, there are atelectatic changes at the lung bases.

ABDOMEN: Innumerable ill-defined solid lesions throughout the liver, some with internal fluid-fluid levels are seen. The largest focus is in or adjacent to the caudate lobe and measures approximately 7.6 x 5.5 cm. There is mass effect on the transiting portal vein, which does remain patent. There is a small amount of perihepatic complex fluid with density measurements compatible with that of blood, likely exudative hemorrhagic/proteinaceous debris. This is seen along the inferior tip of the liver. The visualized portions of the pancreas maintain normal appearance, and there is no pancreatic or biliary dilatation identified. Spleen and adrenal glands also remain normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, with a large right upper pole cyst and a smaller left lower pole cyst. The IVC and aorta maintain patency, although the study was not tailored to assess the patency of the IVC. The largest portion of the mass does abut and exert mass effect on the transiting IVC.

Bowel loops are decompressed. The aorta and major branch vessels are heavily calcified but nondilated. Small amount of fluid is seen layering in the deep pelvis. There is a normal-appearing appendix in the right lower quadrant, which fills with contrast. There is a complete collapse of T12 vertebral body with an inferior endplate compression fracture of L1 and L4. Mild retropulsion of the T12 vertebral body is evident with subtle displacement of the cord at that level. A sclerotic focus is seen within the right hemisacrum, as well as the left iliac bone.

IMPRESSION: Innumerable hepatic lesions, presumably metastases. A miliary pattern of nodules throughout both lungs, also presumably metastases, and left greater than right bihilar lymphadenopathy. Findings may represent a primary lung mass with diffuse thoracic and hepatic metastases. Additional considerations include a diffuse lymphoma, melanoma. Histologic evaluation could be performed via ultrasound-guided liver biopsy as clinically warranted.

T12 compression fracture, age indeterminant.
