==================== ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES: ==================== #AMS #Concern for HE: Altered mental status thought to be ___ hepatic encephalopathy given +asterixis on exam although spoke with son and confirmed that he is taking both lactulose and rifaximin at home (though not always having ___ BM daily at home). Increased lactulose to Q2H until his mental status returned to baseline Alternatively his TSH was 7, but T3/T4 wnl, unclear how helpful this will be iso illness. Infectious workup was negative. Will send home on rifaximin BID and lactulose TID with goal ___ BMs daily. Discussed titrating lactulose at home and low threshold to call doctor if getting more confused or not having enough BMs.

___: Likely in the setting of decrease PO intake while encephalopathic and not liking hospital food. Looking back at ED course, Cr seems to have risen after getting losartan and an increased dose of 50mg while on the floor. Held losartan and given albumin. Creatinine 1.5 on discharge, which is above baseline, but volume status and electrolytes wnl. Will have close follow up as outpatient and continue to hold ___ at discharge.

#Non Anion Gap Metablic Acidosis, improving: Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Unclear etiology as did not get NS while in ED. Could be ___ stool losses from Q2H lactulose or due to ___. VBG with normal pH and appropriate compensation.

Complicated by multifocal HCC in segment III post RF ablation in ___, with new OPTN 5A lesion seen on most recent MRI. History of HE on lactulose and rifaximin -volume: no home diuretics -infection: no prior history of SBP. No ascites on U/S -bleeding: EGD on ___ no varices -encephalopathy: on home lactulose and rifaximin -screening: new OPTN 5A lesion in segment VIII - plan is for TACE in future, has been seen by ___ on ___

#Normocytic Anemia: Appears close to baseline, no active signs of bleeding. Can consider iron studies, B12, and screening colonoscopy as outpatient.
