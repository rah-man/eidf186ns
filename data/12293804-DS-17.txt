This was successfully placed.  Post-procedure period was complicated by worsenign R sided pain, prompting repeat CT scan that R sided perinephric hematoma.  Patient treated conservatively, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, and stabilized. Patient was scheduled for follow-up with ___ for ___ for reassessment of tube.  . # Acute on chronic abdominal pain / Pelvic mass concerning for cancer - Patient's course notable for significant R abdominal and flank pain. Prior imaging and imaging during this admission showed an infiltrative pelvic mass. Her pain was refractory to multiple IV and PO narcotic agents, but did improve with Tylenol with codeine as well as simethicone. She had initially been planned as above for cystoscopy with stent placement and biopsy, but were unable to perform either given difficult anatomy.  Subsequently multiple services were consulted for biopsy what was felt to be a technically difficult biopsy; ERCP was unable to pass scope for EUS-guided biopsy, initial ___ attempt at biopsy did not yield diagnostic tissue and repeat ___ attempt was aborted given lack of safe windows for biopsy. Urology then underwent a laparoscopic evaluation that showed a fixed R ovary with associated mass. She underwent R oopherectomy and excision of mass, with prelim pathology showing high grade transitional carcinoma with extensive lymphovascular invasion.

Patient was seen by social work regularly, reported feeling depressed for some time.  As such, she was started on a trial of citalopram and was provided continued emotional support.  . # Constipation - course was complicated by constipation in setting of poor PO intake and opiates. Repsonded to improved PO intake and initiation of bowel regimen with colace and senna, as well as simethicone for cramping  . # Hypertension - Has historically difficult to control blood pressure. This admission, had elevated blood pressures, prompting increasing of home labetalol dosing. Continued amLODIPine, hydralazine, isosorbide, lisinopril . # CAD s/p CABG / Aortic Stenosis status post Recent TAVR - conitnued ASA. In setting of perinephric hematoma and operative biopsy, plavix was held per discussion with cardiology.  Restarted plavix once she was stable. Continued Atorvastatin, fenofibrate . # Diabetes type 2 - Held glimepiride during inpatient stay, restarted at discharge . # GERD - continued PPI . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed this admission; discharged home with services for continued tube care - RP mass biopsy results pending on discharge, to be discussed at her ___ oncology follow-up with Dr. ___ . . .
