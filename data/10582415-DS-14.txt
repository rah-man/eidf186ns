Discharge physical examination Awake, alert, conversational, appears comfortable  Pertinent Results: CTA ___xamination is limited due to significant beam hardening artifact. Within these limits, there is increased high density lining the sulci of the bilateral frontal lobes consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition there is a layering ventricular blood mildly increased from prior. The ventricles and sulci are significant large consistent with cerebral atrophy, unchanged from prior. High density focus along the inner table of the left frontal bone (series 3, image 17) likely represents a vessel. 1.2 x 1.6 cm calcified dural-based lesion likely represents a meningioma.  Significant periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or large territory infarct. There is no evidence of skull fracture.  CT of the head: The vessels of the circle what is are patent without evidence of large vessel occlusion or intracranial aneurysm. Dural sinuses are patent. Extensive calcification of the bilateral intracranial carotid arteries.  CTA of the neck: There is extensive calcifications of the aortic arch. The bilateral common carotid and vertebral arteries are patent without evidence of high-grade stenosis. There is moderate stenosis due to atherosclerotic calcifications at the carotid bifurcation. Lung apices demonstrate mild centrilobular emphysematous changes.

She was seen by Neurosurgery who felt that it was likely hypertensive in nature & that no intervention was warranted. CTA, however, raised the possibility of an AComm aneurysm. The options for invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions were discussed with Ms. ___, her family, and the medical team, the decision was made to pursue hospice care. She was discharged to inpatient hospice in hemodynamically stable condition.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion resulting from an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely from a ruptured aneurysm. While you were hospitalized, invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions were offered, however, after discussions between you, your family, and your medical team, it was clear that these interventions were not within your goals of care, and comfort directed treatment was pursued. You were discharged to inpatient hospice.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team  Followup Instructions: ___
