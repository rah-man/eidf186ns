U/S - left upper extremity 1. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity.   2. Clot is noted in the cephalic vein at the level of the proximal forearm.  This is a superficial vein and does not represent a DVT.   3. Superficial, diffuse soft tissue edema is noted in the region of the antecubital fossa. 

INDICATION: ___ year old woman with esophageal stricture and malnutrition.   COMPARISON: Esophagogram ___, CT abdomen and pelvis ___.   TECHNIQUE:  OPERATORS: Dr. ___ radiology fellow) and Dr. ___ radiology attending) performed the procedure. The attending, Dr. ___ supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainee's findings   ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 50mcg of fentanyl and 0.25 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 40 during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1% lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site.   MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl and midazolam.   CONTRAST: 20 ml of Optiray contrast.   FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 13 min, 412 cGycm2   PROCEDURE: 1. Placement of a ___ ___ gastrojejunostomy tube.   PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed semi upright on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol.   Lidocaine jelly and spray was applied to the left nostril and back of the throat. An angled glide catheter was advanced through the left nostril into the stomach under fluoroscopy and glidewire guidance.   The tube site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A scout image of the abdomen was obtained. The stomach was insufflated through the indwelling nasogastric catheter. Using a marker, the skin was marked using palpation to feel the costal margins and the liver edge was marked using ultrasound. Ultrasound images were not stored.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, 3 T fastener buttons were sequentially deployed in a triangular position elevating the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. Intra-gastric position was confirmed with aspiration of air and injection of contrast. A 19 gauge needle was introduced under fluoroscopic guidance and position confirmed using an injection of dilute contrast. The needle trajectory was directed towards the pylorus. A ___ wire was introduced and coiled within the stomach. A small skin incision was made along the needle and the needle was removed.   A 7 ___ sheath was placed. A Kumpe catheter was then introduced over the wire and the ___ was exchanged for a Glidewire. The Glidewire and a Kumpe cathter was used to advance the wire into the ___ part of the duodenum. The Glidewire was then exchanged for stiff glidewire. The sheath was then removed and serial dilations were performed. A peel-away sheath was placed over the wire. A 14 ___ ___ gastrojejunostomy catheter was advanced over the wire into position. The sheath was then peeled away. The wire and sheath were removed. The catheter was locked by forming the retaining loop in the stomach after confirming the position of the catheter with a contrast injection.   The catheter was then flushed, capped and secured to the skin with flexi track. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.   FINDINGS:   1. Successful placement of a 14 ___ ___ gastrojejunostomy tube with its tip in the proximal jejunum. 

CT Abd & Pelvis With Contrast (___) 1. No signs of small bowel obstruction. Fluid filled loops of jejunum and ileum with areas of wall thickening likely represent enteritis. 2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with chronic occlusion of the left common iliac artery with extension into the internal and external iliac arteries. 3. Multiple thoracolumbar spinal compression deformities, similar to ___.  KUB ___ COMPARISON: Abdominal radiographs from ___ and ___.   FINDINGS:  Frontal supine and erect abdominal radiographs demonstrate a the gastrojejunal to the projecting over the left upper abdomen.  There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. Multiple punctate hyperdensities projecting over the lower abdomen likely represent flocculation after recent enteric injection of contrast.   IMPRESSION:   Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. 

EGD Third attempt A previously noted 5mm benign stricture at 28cm from the incisors was again visualized. The standard gastroscope was not able to be traverse the stricture. A 8mm balloon was introduced for dilation and the diameter was progressively increased to 9 mm successfully.  Stomach: Not examined. Duodenum: Not examined. Impression: A previously noted 5mm benign stricture at 28cm from the incisors was again visualized. The standard gastroscope was not able to be traverse the stricture.  A 8mm balloon was introduced for dilation and the diameter was progressively increased to 9 mm successfully Otherwise normal EGD to lower third of the esophagus  Recommendations: Repeat EGD for dilation in 2 weeks with Dr. ___. Will likely need ___ dilation under flurosocopic guidance. If any chest or abdominal pain, fevers, bleeding, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting or any other concerning post procedure symptom, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call ___ ___. 

EGD x2 Impression: A tight pinhole stricture that appeared at 28 cm from the incisors was identified. The esophageal mucosa to the level of the stricture was normal. At the stricture there was edema, exudate and ulceration seen likely related to earlier dilation. A guidewire was passed under fluorosocopic guidance into a dilated stomach. However, its short angulated path beyond the stricture suggested a foreshortened esophagus. With the aid of a biliary balloon, contrast was injected to better identify the anatomy of the stricture but pooled above the stricture. Given, an unusual anatomy that could not be fully defined and the inflammation due to ealier dilation, the decision was made to posptpone dilation until after a barium swallow could be obtained to delineate the stricture.  Recommendations: Obtain Barium Swallow. ___ guided PEG placement on ___ and attempt at further dilation on ___. If any fever, worsening abdominal pain, or post procedure symptoms, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on call ___/ pager ___. Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. ___ the GI fellow. The attending was present for the entire procedure. FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were taken for pathology 

EGDx1 Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: A benign intrinsic 5 mm stricture that appeared at 28 cm from the incisors was seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The scope did not traverse the lesion. A 8mm balloon was introduced for dilation successfully.  Other After dilation an attempt was made to pass the baby endoscope beyond the stricture and the area was too narrow to allow passage.  Stomach: not examined Duodenum: not examined Impression: Stricture of the lower third of the esophagus (dilation) After dilation an attempt was made to pass the baby endoscope beyond the stricture and the area was too narrow to allow passage. Recommendations: If any questions or you need to schedule an office appointment or procedure call ___ MD at ___ or email at ___. To properly dilate this likely radiation stricture sfely flouroscopy is needed. I have discussed this with Dr. ___ will dilate under fluoro today. Additional notes: FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were taken for pathology 

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with a history of TAH/BSO in ___ and chronic diarrhea related to radiation, who has a recent history of breast cancer (___) treated with left mastectomy and radiation who presents with nausea, dysphagia and poor PO intake. She was seen in the ED with possible partial SBO prior to ___. She returned with nausea and vomiting associated with meds and dysphagia. She had a CT with enteritis treated with Cipro and Flagyl x 5 days. She was found to have a benign appearing distal esophageal stricture.

ACUTE ISSUES: -------------- ESOPHAGEAL STRICTURE: She underwent EGD which showed lower esophageal stricture though unable to dilate on ___. . UGI series confirmed esoph stricture. On ___, EGD reattempted (benign in appearance) and it was dilated to 8 mm. Liquids were reattempted but she was unable to tolerate liquids. Given concerns re: malnutrition, a PEG tube was requested to be placed by ___ on ___. Repeat dilation was attempted on two more occasions and was unsuccessful. GI team plans to attempt a repeat dilation in two weeks. She is to remain NPO until esophageal stricture is successfully dilated.

HYPERTENSION: BP meds held as she was normotensive without any blood pressure medication.

Chronic Diarrhea: Per the patient she has had an exhaustive workup for chronic diarrhea that was performed by her Gastroenterologist at ___ that revealed that her diarrhea was secondary to effects of radiation that she had ___ years ago after her hysterectomy.  She continued to have diarrhea while in the hospital on tube feeds, and she had some response to immodium.

Pain at site of GJ tube: She was evaluated by ___ and and films that showed the GJ tube was positioned properly. She continued to have pain along the insertion site several days after placement - likely structural - she had an adult tube placed when she is only 60 lbs. She responds to heat packs and tylenol for the pain. ___ does not feel that the tube needs to be repositioned. 

MALNUTRITION/Weight loss Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia all noted on admission: Likely due to malnutrition and diarrhea. She was repleted aggressively during her admission and her abnormalities were corrected. 

Her weight on discharge was 65 pounds.  I have talked to her and her niece and friend. They all report very rapid weight loss in the past few months; they believed that her recent move was very difficult for her and her diarrhea worsened during the stress.  Her weight loss also accelerated after she developed an esophageal stricture and was unable to take PO. 

I discussed with her and her HCP at length her overall frailty and low weight. Perhaps she will be able to gain weight with tube feeds, but her diarrhea may continue (diarrhea is common with tube feeds, and she clearly has some underlying malabsorption secondary to her prior radiation treatment) but it may not. Should her weight continue to fall, I urged her to reconsider her goals of care and to consider comfort measures and discontinuation of the tube. 

She is a DNR/DNI, and she would like to return in a few weeks for reattempt at dilation of the esophageal sphincter. She is aware of her overall poor health, low weight. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: -------------- BREAST CANCER:  Held anastrozole during hospitalization - if she wishes to continue it at rehab, it would have to be crushed and then put in G tube. We cancelled her oncology f/u given her overall poor condition. If her weight improves she may consider rescheduling f/u.

Code status: DNR/DNI I discussed her condition in full with her health care proxy.  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY 2. anastrozole 1 mg oral daily 3. Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY 

 Discharge Medications: 1. Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg G TUBE DAILY 2. Acetaminophen (Liquid) 650 mg NG Q6H:PRN pain/fever 3. LOPERamide 1 mg PO DAILY:PRN diarrhea 

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: ___  Discharge Diagnosis: Enteritis Dysphagia Esophageal stricture Malnutrition

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to ___ with difficulty swallowing food and pills. You were taken for an endoscopy which found a stricture of your esophagus - this was thought to be benign (not cancer).  The stricture was dilated on ___ to 8 mm and but we were unable to dilate it further.  You had a GJ tube placed for feeding given your weight loss and diarrhea. We are discharging you to rehab with the hope that you are able to gain weight and strength as a result of your supplemental feedings. Our gastroenterologists will contact you at the rehab because they would like to attempt a dilation again.  When you first were admitted, you seemed to have an infection in your small bowel which was treated with antibiotics for 5 days.  Followup Instructions: ___
