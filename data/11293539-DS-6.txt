 History of Present Illness: This ___ year-old woman with PMH significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and PAF who was in her usual state of health until approximately 9 months ago (___, when she began to experience weight loss due to diminished appetite. In ___ she developed GI distress and melanotic stools. She was admitted to ___ for one night on ___ complaining of several months of melena and a 25lb weight loss. She was briefly admitted to a hospital in ___, where an EGD disclosed ulcers. She was treated for these but continued to have diarrhea, without melena. Overall, she has lost a total of 30 lbs, or 20% of her body weight.

She returned from ___ in ___ and underwent colonoscopy here at ___ on ___ showing severe-appearing sigmoid diverticulosis. As the sigmoid colon appeared fixed, more proximal colon was not visualized. Virtual colonography on ___ revealed a 3.4 x 2.7 cm left para-aortic mass with associated left side hydronephrosis. EUS on ___ identified a round 1.5cm para-aortic node with an adjacent irregular 3.5 x 3.5 cm hypoechoic mass with hyperechoic foci. Both masses abutted the aorta.

FNA of the mass on ___ was consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A staging torso CT on ___ showed only several pulmonary nodules ~1cm in diameter, and severe left hydronephrosis. GU U/S confirmed the left hydroureteronephrosis, presumed secondary to the para-aortic lymphadenopathy.

She was admitted and underwent ureteral stent placement on ___. Though the procedure was uncomplicated, about 10min afterwards she reported chills and tachycardia. She was admitted to the urology service.  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus 2. Hypothyroidism 3. Hypertension 4. Hypercholesterolemia 5. Glaucoma 6. Osteoarthritis 7.

IMAGING:

___ CXR: Lung volumes are slightly low causing mild bronchovascular crowding, particularly at the bases. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple pulmonary nodules better seen on the recent CT torso are again noted. There is no adenopathy. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Aortic contour is unfolded. There is a left ureteral stent, partially visualized. 

___ RENAL U/S: The right kidney measures 9.5 cm. The left kidney measures 10.0 cm. There is no hydronephrosis in either side, with apparent interval resolution of the left hydronephrosis. The left ureteral stent is vaguely visible at the left UPJ. A punctate 2-mm echogenic foci noted in the left mid pole, without posterior shadowing, non-specific and could represent a portion of the ureteral stent or a tiny non-obstructive, non-shadowing stone. There is no perinephric fluid collection. A hypoechoic area is noted posterior to and distinct from the left kidney, could represent the psoas muscle or the known retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The non-fully distended bladder is noted with a small amount of debris in the dependent portion. 

___ RETROGRADE UROGRAPHY (FILMS FROM CYSTO): There is evidence of left hydronephrosis with blunting of the calices. A left ureteral stent was placed with proximal tip in the renal pelvis, distal tip is not seen on the fluoroscopic images.  Brief Hospital Course: This is an ___ year-old woman with para-aortic retroperitoneal masses found on FNA to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown origin, and causing partial obstruction of her left ureter leading to left hydronephrosis. She presented on ___ for outpatient left ureteral stent placement. Though the procedure was uncomplicated, she reported chills and tachycardia shortly afterwards. She was started empirically on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole and was admitted to urology. Of note, urine cultures from ___ had grown ciprofloxacin and ampicillin resistant E. coli. She also developed a large amount of diarrhea later on the day of the procedure. Despite the antibiotics her WBC rose from 19 to 34 before beginning to trend down. She was transferred to medicine on ___, at which time her WBC was back to 19. Her coverage was narrowed according to sensitivities. 

# Leukocytosis. Given the positive cultures, it is likely the minor trauma of the procedure allowed enough bacterial translocation to allow a transient GN bacteremia with consequent leukemoid reaction. Blood cultures from the day of procedure remain negative. Given her diarrhea and numerous recent hospitalizations, C. difficile was considered as an explanation of her leukocytosis; two studies were sent, both negative. Her WBC continued to trend down to 11 on morning of discharge. She was asymptomatic from ___ until her discharge on ___.

# Complicated urinary tract infection. While she did endorse some cloudy urine prior to her stent placement, she denied any UTI symptoms after admisson. Despite her high WBC, she was afebrile and stable on the floor. Sensitivities on the ___ urine culture showed the E. coli to be bactrim sensitive, so we narrowed coverage to bactrim for a 14 day course. Follow up urine studies on ___ showed E. coli at 3000/ml. U/A from the same day showed 68 WBC. She was remained afebrile on the floor, with a decreasing WBC. She is advised to be on the lookout for UTI symptoms, as her altered anatomy and stent place her at higher risk of infection. Follow up U/S on ___ showed interval resolution of the left hydronephrosis. She will follow up with Dr. ___ urology on ___.

# Carcinoma of unknown primary. She expressed a thorough understanding of her malignancy, including the uncertainty of the diagnosis. She was inclined to go on family vacation to ___ before addressing the issue further. She is scheduled with for CT guided biopsy on ___. She will see her PCP, ___. ___, on ___ at this meeting they will discuss oncological follow-up.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. On the floor, she became tachycardic to the 140s. She received 5mg IV metoprolol, and shortly thereafter regained NSR. She remained in NSR until discharge. We maintained her on metoprolol 25mg BID after the episode of atrial fibrillation. As her baseline heart rate was in the ___ and systolic blood pressure in the 130s, we added metoprolol XL 50mg to her discharge medications. As she was asymptomatic throughout, it is unclear how often these events occur. We noted that she is CHADS 3 and could benefit from coumadin, though her recent history of melena does complicate this decision and it should be readdressed as an outpatient.  She was continued on aspirin only.

# Abdominal pain. She complained of a circumferential painful band, non-tender to palpation, over the abdomen extending from pubis to umbilicus. This could be due to stretch on her left kidney capsule, or due to direct involvement of nerve roots by her retroperitoneal mass. If the former, her pain may improve secondary to the stent. In either case, she endorsed improvement with lidocaine patch and with tramadol. She was discharged with both of these medications.

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her blood glucoses were stable during this admission. We maintained her home glipizide and metformin. She received no insulin.

# Weight loss. This is likely secondary to her malignancy and to her persistent diarrhea. Her appetite is significantly reduced. We advised her to eat what she can tolerate, and to supplement her diet with calorie rich liquids such as Ensure.

# Diarrhea. She developed some significant diarrhea after the stent placement. Inasmuch as she has some diarrhea at baseline, we felt it was unlikely an infectious etiology. However, given her recent hospitalizations we sent two C. difficile studies, both negative. Though her stools remained somewhat loose, the diarrhea she experienced on the day of the stent placement did not recur.

# Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glaucoma, osteopenia, hypothyroidism. These problems were stable. We maintained home medications.  Medications on Admission: 1. Aspirin 81 mg  2.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left hydronephrosis, E. coli urinary tract infection Secondary: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, carcinoma of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).

 Discharge Instructions: You initially came to ___ for placement of a stent in your ureter, the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder. This stent was placed to relieve pressure on your left kidney.  Imaging since placement of the stent shows that the pressure on your kidney has begun to resolve. 

After placement of the stent you began experiencing chills. We started treating you with antibiotics. Studies of your blood showed that your white blood cell count was increased; these are the cells that fight infection. Looking back at your records, you had had evidence of a urinary tract infection prior to your stent placement. It is likely that some of the bacteria causing that infection were able to enter your bloodstream during the procedure, which caused your symptoms and the elevation in white blood cells. After initiating antibiotics, your symptoms resolved, you have been afebrile, and your white blood cell count has decreased. We changed you to an antibiotic called bactrim that is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections.

You also continued to experience pain around your abdomen in a band-like pattern. This may be due to the enlarged kidney, and may resolve now that the ureteral stent is in place. It may also be due to the enlarged lymph nodes triggering your pain receptors. You found that a lidocaine patch helped with the pain.

On the floor, you had an episode of atrial fibrillation causing your heart rate to increase. We gave you a medication called metoprolol, which slowed your heart rate. You resumed a normal hearth rhythm for the remainder of your stay.

Please note the following changes to your medications: - Please continue to take metoprolol as directed; this is a small dose. Dr. ___ assess the need for continuing this medication at your next appointment. - For pain, continue to use the lidocaine patch, tylenol, and tramadol as needed. Please do not take more than 3000mg of the tylenol daily as it can cause damage to your liver.  - Please take zofran as needed for nausea. - Please continue to take your other medications as you did prior to your hospitalization.

The following appointments have been made for you: - CT guided biopsy: Please come to the ___ floor of the ___ building on the ___ on ___ at 9:00 AM. Your biopsy will take place later on the same day, ___, in the ___ floor of the ___ building at 10:30AM. - Dr. ___: Please see Dr. ___ on ___, 8:30 AM, on the ___ floor of the ___ building. - Dr. ___: Please see Dr. ___ on the ___ floor of the ___ on ___ at 10:30AM.  Followup Instructions: ___
