IMAGING:

Portable CXR ___: As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are lower with associated accentuation of cardiomediastinal contours in crowding of bronchovascular structures. New bibasilar patchy opacities have developed, left greater than right, which could potentially be due to developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, particularly at the left base. Aspiration is an additional consideration. Exam is otherwise remarkable for small left pleural effusion and linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe. 

MRCP ___ IMPRESSION:   1. Interval increase in the size of an ill-defined hilar metastasis in segment 4A/B resulting in biliary obstruction, and upstream dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. The biliary enteric anastomosis is not well seen. 2. Interval worsening of multiple metastatic lesions within the liver, predominating in segments 4A, 4B, and 5. 3. Superimposed inflammatory cholangitis in the central liver. 

___ PTC FINDINGS:  Mild to moderately dilated right biliary tree. Successful placement of an 8 ___ modified 8 APD internal/external catheter through the biliary system and into the small bowel. 

___ catheter check IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange, repositioning and upsize to a right ___ internal-external biliary drain.  RECOMMENDATION(S): Keep to bag drainage, and consider capping trial tomorrow. 

IMPRESSION:   Preliminary Report1. Interval improvement in the biliary duct dilation in the segment of the Preliminary Reportright lobe of the liver which is being drained by the PTBD. The biliary Preliminary Reportdilation in the remainder of the liver has slightly worsened, as described Preliminary Reportabove. The post-contrast images are limited by the timing of the contrast Preliminary Reportbolus and motion, though there is no definite active cholangitis. Preliminary Report2. The known hepatic metastases are not significantly changed. Due to the Preliminary Reportpatient's inability to breath hold and remain still for an MRI, consider using Preliminary ReportCT for future follow-up exams. Preliminary Report3. Expected postoperative changes after a Whipple. Preliminary Report4. Mild splenomegaly. Preliminary Report5. Small amount of ascites. Preliminary Report6. Partially imaged unchanged thoracic aortic aneurysm. Preliminary Report7. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
