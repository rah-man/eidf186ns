CXR: prelim read: The lungs are clear. No consolidation is identified to suggest aspiration. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior. Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is also stable. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No aspiration. 

EGD ___: Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Mild erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis (biopsy). Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy). Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

Colonoscopy ___: Mild erythema in the descending and ascending colon compatible with nonspecific erythema (biopsy). Normal mucosa in the colon. Internal hemorrhoids. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.

Gastric biopsies ___: Chronic active gastritis with focal intestinal metaplasia and foci suggestive of poorly formed granuloma. Immunohistochemical stain for Helicobacter is negative with adequate controls. GMS stain is negative for fungal organisms. Stain for AFB is negative with adequate controls. B. Duodenal biopsies: Well formed villi are present focally. There is a focal mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and neutrophils in the epithelium. The findings are not specific. C. Random colon biopsies: Very focal active cryptitis and very focal poorly formed granulomas. No diagnostic changes of chronic colitis seen.

MRE: IMPRESSION: 1. Left ovarian dermoid cyst. 2.  Multiloculated ovarian cystic lesions, left greater than right, raise concern for epithelial neoplasms. Recommend pelvic MRI, preferably with contrast (requiring premedication in light of patient allergy). 3. Normal MR enterography. 4. Left renal RFA, without evidence of recurrence.

We recently performed a hydrogen/methane breath test on your patient to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

The procedure was performed using 10g of lactulose mixed in 8 ounces of water. After ingestion of the solution, hydrogen and methane breath samples were then obtained every 15 minutes for 1.5 hours.

The readings of hydrogen/methane for your patient were as follows:            hydrogen/methane Baseline:    ___ ppm 15 minutes:   ___ ppm 30 minutes:   ___ ppm 45 minutes:   ___ ppm 60 minutes:   ___ ppm 75 minutes:   ___ ppm 90 minutes:   38/00 ppm

This study is suggestive of a positive result for bacterial overgrowth based on a rise of equal to or greater than 20ppm of hydrogen or methane within 90 minutes. However, transit time for lactulose through the small bowel to colon is variable and therefore false positive results can not be excluded especially in patients with late rises in hydrogen and/or methane.

 Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history of DM2, HTN, HLD, Grave's disease, anemia, obesity presents with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and found to have a positive bacterial overgrowth breath test.

# Bacterial overgrowth: Pt presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Chronic in nature. Prior evaluation with GI with abnormal pathology although no clear diagnosis. Pt admitted and fluid resuscitated. Pt underwent bacterial overgrowth testing (see above) which was positive. Thus the patient was started on Rifaxamin and discharged with GI follow-up. The patients symptoms had completely resolved on the day of discharge. The patient was also instructed to change from tablet immodium to liquid immodium for better titration. 

# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease stage III: Improved with IVF and in the setting of poor PO intake and diarrhea. Initially all BP meds (ACEi, ___, HCTZ) were held. The patient Cr improved back to baseline and her ACEi was restarted in discharge. . # Macular Pruritic Rash: Pt developed pruritis macular rash while in house on arms, legs and back. No clear precipitant. Appeared to blanch. Potentially due to the patients bed sheets. No medication precipitant was identified. Pt was given low dose hydrocortisone cream for treatment.

# Anemia: Clinically stable while in house. Unclear etiology. 

# HTN: Well controlled while in house

# DM2: controlled, no complications noted. Held glipizide given renal function. ISS. Restarted on home meds upon discharge.

# Grave's disease: presumably post treatment given levothyroxine. Check TSH.

# HLD: Continue statin.

# s/p rescection of cysts: follow gyn recs
