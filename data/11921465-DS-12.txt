Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of bronchiectasis and MAC, who presented with symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, found to have imaging concerning for PNA.

#Pneumonia: The patient was diagnosed by PCP ___ ___ w/ left lobe PNA and treated ___ outpatient setting w/ 7d course of levofloxacin. Given her past use of levofloxacin, she was treated with Cefepime initially, then transitioned to Cefpodoxime. ___ the context of this, she developed a rash, which we believed likely due to a cephalosporin allergy, and her cephalosporin antibiotics were therefore discontinued. ID was consulted and recommended cessation of antibiotics for now. Chest CT on ___ suggested that the right lower lobe infiltration seen on chest x-ray was not a new pneumonia. She was afebrile throughout hospital stay. ___ sputum culture showed gram positive cocci ___ pairs, chains, and clusters and gram negative diplococcic, unclear if pathogenic or colonization, but given clinical stability antibiotics were withheld. Speech and Swallow eval showed no evidence of significant aspiration. We communicated with Dr. ___ pulmonologist, who will continue to follow the patient ___ the outpatient setting.

# Positive blood culture: 1 bottle from admission grew Coag negative Staph, which was subsequently determined to be likely a contaminant. She was initially given Vancomycin, but this was discontinued given the low likelihood of bloodstream infection.

Chronic: #GERD: The patient has a past medical history of GERD. We continued her Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID. #Depression: The patient has a past medical history of depression. She is doing well here without any antidepressants. #Osteoporosis: The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis not on supplementation.
