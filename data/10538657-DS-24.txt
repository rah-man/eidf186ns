Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  

 Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. ___ was brought to the operating room on ___ where she underwent an Re-do Sternotomy, Mitral valve replacement with a ___ 29 mm Epic tissue valve, serial #___, reference ___. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 101 minutes with a cross clamp of 58 minutes. She tolerated the operation well and following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Her AICD was interrogated and activated. She remained hemodynamically stable, sedation was weaned, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. All other tubes, lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol without complication. She was started on Beta-blockers, diuretics and these were titrated as needed. Her anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation was resumed. She transitioned from an insulin drip to SQ with good blood sugar control. On POD1 she was transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor for continued recovery. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged to home with ___ of ___ in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
