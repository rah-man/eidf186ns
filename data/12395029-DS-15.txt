Imaging Studies: ======================================= ___: CTA Chest with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1. Large left pleural effusion increased from ___ and new since ___ with left lower lung collapse. Scattered left pleural nodularity raises concern for malignancy, differential includes but is not limited to mesothelioma or lung cancer. Thoracentesis is recommended with cytology for further evaluation. 2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 3. Partially thrombosed celiac artery aneurysm measures up to 1.6 cm in diameter, stable since ___, close monitoring is recommended. 4. Uncomplicated aorto-bi-iliac stent graft with coiling of the left internal iliac artery.  Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old male smoker, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease with shortness of breath and chest tightness found to have a large left pleural effusion with pleural nodularity concerning for malignancy.

# Pleural effusion: patient presented with shortness of breath and had more than 2.5 L of blood drained from left pleural space in the emergency department with improvement in his shortness of breath. Pleural cultures sent did not show any growth, cytology was also sent. CT scan showed nodularity in the pleura concerning for malignancy. Fluid met exudate criteria, but he remained afebrile during his stay and antibiotics were never given. Before discharge, he had his pigtail pleural catheter removed with plans to return to the hospital later in the week for a lung biopsy and possible talc pleurodesis.

# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine bumped on admission to 1.4, likely in the setting of diminished food intake prior to admission. Nephrotoxic hypertension medications were held and he was given fluids. Creatine trended down during his stay.

# Hypertension: all home medications that were not nephrotoxic were continued when he was admitted. Never had signs of a hypertensive crisis.

# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: did not have exacerbation, but was placed on dual nebulizer as needed for shortness of breath.

Code status: the patient was full code throughout the hospital stay.
