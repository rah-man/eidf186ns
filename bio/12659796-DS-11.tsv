FINDINGS:	O
There	O
are	O
innumerable	O
enhancing	O
lesions	O
throughout	O
both	O
cerebral	O
hemispheres.	O
The	O
largest	O
of	O
these,	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
occipital	O
lobe,	O
measures	O
approximately	O
4	O
cm	O
in	O
diameter	O
and	O
is	O
associated	O
with	O
extensive	O
surrounding	O
edema.	O
The	O
other	O
lesions	O
have	O
variable	O
amounts	O
of	O
edema.	O
The	O
right	O
occipital	O
edema	O
extends	O
into	O
the	O
posterior	O
temporal	O
lobe	O
and	O
into	O
the	O
corpus	O
callosum.	O
This	O
produces	O
mass	O

on	O
the	O

There	O

in	O
this	O
largest	O
lesion	O
on	O
the	O

These	O
findings	O
suggest	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
hemorrhage	O
within	O
the	O
lesion,	O
although	O
calcification	O
is	O
an	O
alternate	O
possibility.	O
The	O
numerous	O
smaller	O
lesions	O
raise	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O
some	O
may	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
pial	O
surface	O
and	O
perhaps	O
reflect	O

infiltration.	O
The	O
largest	O
lesion	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
lesions	O
have	O
areas	O
of	O
central	O
hypointensity	O
after	O
contrast	O
suggesting	O
necrosis.	O
Altogether,	O
these	O
findings	O
most	O
likely	O
represent	O
metastatic	O
disease.	O
An	O
MRA	O
was	O
performed.	O
This	O
demonstrates	O
a	O
12-mm	O

from	O
the	O
supraclinoid	O
internal	O

near	O

There	O
are	O
no	O
MR	O
findings	O
to	O
suggest	O

There	O
is	O
apparent	O
narrowing	O
of	O
the	O
mid	O

on	O
this	O

However,	O
this	O
appears	O
most	O

to	O
be	O
an	O
MR	O

If	O
further	O
