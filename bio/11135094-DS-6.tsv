Instructions:	O
Mr.	O
___,	O
You	O
were	O
admitted	O
to	O
the	O
hospital	O
because	O
you	O
were	O
having	O
weakness	O
in	O
your	O
feet	O
and	O
legs.	O
You	O
had	O
an	O
MRI	O
which	O
showed	O
some	O
possible	O
compression	O
of	O
your	O
spinal	O
cord,	O
but	O
the	O
neurosurgery	O
team	O
felt	O
that	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
warrant	O
immediate	O
surgery.	O
You	O
were	O
also	O
started	O
on	O
antibiotics	O
for	O
a	O

infection.	O
You	O

recommended	O

facility	O
until	O
you	O

physically	O

However,	O
you	O
would	O
rather	O
return	O
home	O
now.	O
You	O
should	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
physical	O
therapy	O
team	O
feels	O
this	O
is	O
unsafe,	O
but	O
ultimately	O
it	O
is	O
your	O
decision.	O
This	O
discharge	O
is	O
therefore	O
"against	O
medical	O
advice".	O
