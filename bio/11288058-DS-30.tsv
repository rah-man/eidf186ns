of	O
your	O
fevers	O
was	O
E.	O
coli	O
bacteremia,	O
which	O
means	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
a	O
microorganism	O
growing	O
in	O
your	O
blood.	O
Our	O
transplant	O
surgery	O
team	O
does	O
not	O
feel	O
that	O
your	O
graft	O
is	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
infection.	O
You	O
were	O
seen	O
by	O
our	O
infectious	O
disease	O
specialists	O
and	O
were	O
started	O
on	O
antibiotics;	O
they	O
also	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
unlikely	O
that	O
your	O
graft	O
was	O
the	O
cause.	O
An	O
ultrasound	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
any	O
big	O
clots	O
in	O
your	O
arm	O
or	O
graft.	O
Imaging	O
of	O
your	O
hearts	O
howed	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
infections	O
on	O
the	O
valves	O
of	O
your	O
heart.	O
We	O
then	O
obtained	O
a	O
CT	O
(imaging)	O
of	O
your	O
abdomen	O
and	O
pelvis	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
any	O
source	O
of	O
infection	O
there.	O
No	O
abscesses	O
were	O
seen,	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
concern	O
that	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
stone	O
obstructing	O
your	O
common	O
bile	O
duct.	O
Because	O
of	O
this	O
concern,	O
you	O
underwent	O
a	O
procedure	O
to	O
examine	O
and	O
open	O
up	O
the	O
sphincter	O
where	O
your	O
biliary	O
tree	O
meets	O
your	O
intestine.	O
That	O
examination	O
went	O
well	O
and	O
cleaned	O
out	O
some	O
sludge	O
and	O
debris,	O
but	O
no	O
stone	O
was	O
found.	O
.	O
You	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
fever	O
after	O
you	O
started	O
antibiotics,	O
so	O
we	O
think	O
that	O
your	O
infection	O
is	O
well-controlled.	O
We	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
home	O
and	O
then	O
receive	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
antibiotics	O
during	O
your	O
hemodialysis.	O
.	O
START	O
cefazolin	O
for	O
two	O
weeks	O
at	O
your	O
dialysis	O
sessions.	O
