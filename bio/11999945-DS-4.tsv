Dear	O
Ms.	O
___,	O
You	O
were	O

the	O
hospital	O
for	O
a	O
heart	O
electrical	O
conduction	O
problem	O
called	O
atrial	O
fibrillation.	O
You	O
were	O
initially	O
treated	O
for	O
this	O
problem	O
with	O
a	O
medication	O
called	O
metoprolol,	O
however	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
well	O
controlled	O
and	O
still	O
caused	O
you	O
to	O
be	O
short	O
of	O
breath.	O
For	O
this	O
reason,	O
we	O
did	O
a	O
procedure	O
called	O
cardioversion	O
to	O
restore	O
your	O
heart	O
to	O
beating	O
in	O
a	O
normal	O
rhythm.	O
Prior	O
to	O
the	O
procedure,	O
we	O
did	O
an	O
ultrasound	O
of	O
your	O
heart	O
called	O
a	O
transesophageal	O
echocardiogram	O
or	O
TEE	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
blood	O
clots	O
in	O
your	O
heart.	O
The	O
procedure	O
was	O
successful	O
and	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
problems	O
afterwards.	O
We	O
started	O
you	O
on	O
a	O
medication	O
called	O
flecainide	O
to	O
help	O
keep	O
your	O
heart	O
beating	O
in	O
a	O
normal	O
rhythm	O
and	O
a	O
medication	O
called	O
rivaroxaban	O
to	O
help	O
prevent	O
any	O
blood	O
clots	O
from	O
forming.	O
This	O
will	O
replace	O
the	O
coumadin	O
you	O
were	O
taking,	O
and	O
you	O
no	O
longer	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
your	O
INR	O
levels	O
checked	O
regularly.	O
Your	O
metoprolol	O
dose	O
was	O
adjusted	O
to	O
25mg	O
daily.	O
It	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
follow	O
up	O
with	O
your	O
cardiologist	O
to	O
