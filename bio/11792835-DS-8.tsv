Per	O
his	O
daughter's	O
report	O
(serving	O
as	O
___),	O
the	O
patient	O
first	O
had	O
difficulty	O
standing	O
approximately	O
one	O
year	O
ago,	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
hospitalized	O
for	O
vascular	O
disease	O
of	O
the	O
lower	O
extremities.	O
The	O
patient	O
and	O
family	O
report	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
"clots,"	O
however,	O
he	O
was	O
apparently	O
assessed	O
by	O
vascular	O
surgery	O
and	O
was	O
never	O
started	O
on	O
anticoagulation.	O
It	O
does	O
appear	O
that	O
he	O
underwent	O
left	O
SFA	O
angioplasty	O
and	O
stenting	O
at	O
___	O
in	O
___.	O
The	O
patient	O
reports	O
that	O
the	O
weakness	O
was	O
most	O
pronounced	O
in	O
the	O
distal	O
lower	O
extremities	O
at	O
that	O
time,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
able	O
to	O
walk	B-Independently_mobile
independently	B-Independently_mobile
and	O
without	O
falling.	B-Falls
The	O
weakness	O
persisted	O
for	O
~	O
3	O
weeks	O
after	O
the	O
hospitalization,	O
but	O
it	O
gradually	O
resolved	O
and	O
his	O
strength	O
apparently	O
returned	O
to	O
baseline.	O
He	O
could	O
walk	O
distances	O
without	O
limitation.	O
Eight	O
months	O
ago,	O
the	O
patient	O
first	O
noted	O
numbness	O
in	O
his	O
feet	O
that	O
has	O
gradually	O
progressed	O
upwards	O
to	O
his	O
hips	O
bilaterally.	O
Approximately	O
6	O
months	O
ago,	O
he	O
was	O
admitted	O
to	O
the	O
hospital	O
again	O
for	O
hypertension	O
and	O
back	O
pain.	O
The	O
exact	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
back	O
pain	O
is	O
unclear,	O
though	O
the	O
patient	O
states	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
spine,	O
indicating	O
the	O
lumbosacral	O
region	O
when	O
asked.	O
He	O
apparently	O
underwent	O
a	O
lumbar	O
puncture,	O
but	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
daughter	O
are	O
unsure	O
of	O
its	O
exact	O
nature	O
or	O
the	O
results.	O
They	O
do	O
state	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
started	O
on	O
a	O
medication	O
at	O
that	O
time,	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
clear	O
if	O
these	O
were	O
antimicrobials.	O
After	O
discharge,	O
his	O
daughter	O
notes	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
stand	O
for	O
any	O
prolonged	O
period,	O
such	O
as	O
to	O
shower	O
or	O
shave.	O
He	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
from	O
room-to-room	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
with	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
cane,	O
but	O
not	O
further	O
distances.	O
By	O
one	O
report,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
worsening	O
dyspnea	O
on	O
exertion	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
(progressively	O
worsening	O
to	O
a	O
distance	O
of	O
even	O
___	O
feet),	O
though	O
the	O
patient	O
denies	O
dyspnea	O
in	O
this	O
interview.	O
His	O
daughter	O
states	O
that	O
his	O
strength	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
his	O
ability	O
to	O
stand	O
and	O
walk	O
improved	O
somewhat	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
five	O
months	O
until	O
___	O
weekend,	O
though	O
he	O
never	O
returned	O
to	O
his	O
baseline	O
one	O
year	O
ago.	O
On	O
___,	O
his	O
daughter	O
notes	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
help	O
him	O
off	O
the	O
toilet	O
when	O
he	O
could	O
not	B-Mobile_with_assistance
stand	B-Mobile_with_assistance
on	B-Mobile_with_assistance
his	B-Mobile_with_assistance

She	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
bedroom,	O
only	O
holding	O
his	O
hand	O
for	O
guidance.	O
However,	O
she	O
states	O
that	O
his	O
legs	O
seemed	O
to	O
buckle	O
at	O
the	O
knees	O
"stiff	O
below	O
the	O

He	O
fell	I-Falls
on	O
his	O
buttocks,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
hit	O
his	O
head.	O
Over	O
the	O
next	O
week,	O
he	O
simply	O
slid	O
from	O
the	O
bed	O
to	O
the	O
floor	O
whenever	O
he	O
attempted	O
to	O

up.	O
He	O
relied	O
on	O
a	O

He	O
has	O
