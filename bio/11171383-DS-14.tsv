You	O
had	O
the	O

Analysis	O
of	O
the	O
fluid	O
shows	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
most	O
likely	O
ovarian	O
cancer,	O
though	O
breast	O
cancer	O

a	O
possibility	O
as	O
well.	O
We	O
talked	O
about	O
treatments,	O
including	O
hormonal	O
treatments,	O
which	O
might	O
prolong	O
your	O
life	O
or	O
palliate	O
symptoms.	O
