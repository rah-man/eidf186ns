You	O
were	O
found	O

a	O

(UTI).	B-Urinary_tract_infection
Because	O

the	O

they	O
caused	O
your	O
blood	O
sugar	O
level	O
to	O
become	O
really	O
high	O
and	O
exacerbated	O
your	O

We	O
treated	O
in	O
the	O
intensive	O
care	O
unit	O
(ICU)	O
initially	O
with	O
broad	O
antibiotics	O
and	O
flu	O
medication.	O
Your	O
kidney	O
was	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
damaged,	O
but	O
it	O
improved	O
after	O
we	O
gave	O
you	O

You	O
were	O
shortly	O

out	O

the	O

to	O
the	O
regular	O

where	O
we	O
continued	O
your	O
flu	O
medication.	O
Your	O
flu	O
symptoms	O
improved	O
quickly.	O
We	O
eventually	O
found	O
that	O
your	O
UTI	B-Urinary_tract_infection
was	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
yeast,	O
and	O
we	O
switched	O
you	O
from	O
antibiotics	O
to	O
an	O
antifungal	O
medication.	O
We	O
had	O
to	O
adjust	O
your	O
immunesuppression	O
regimen	O
due	O
to	O
elevated	O
levels	O
of	O
tacrolimus	O
and	O
drug	O
interactions.	O
Last,	O
we	O
stopped	O
your	O
azathioprine	O
out	O
of	O
concern	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
have	O
contributed	O

which	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
monitored	O
as	O
an	O
outpatient.	O
We	O
also	O
found	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
an	O
infection	O
with	O
a	O
virus	O
called	O

Your	O

will	O
monitor	O
your	O

this	O

from	O

After	O

it	O
was	O
determined	O
that	O
