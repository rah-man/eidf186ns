Dear	O
Ms.	O
___,	O
You	O
were	O
admitted	O
to	O
the	O
hospital	O
after	O
you	O
had	O
an	O
episode	O
of	O
syncope	O
(passing	O
out).	O
We	O
ruled	O
out	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
as	O
the	O
cause,	O
and	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
signs	O
of	O
irregular	O
heart	O
rhythm	O
while	O
in	O
the	O
hospital.	O
You	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
dehydrated	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
feel	O
dizzy	O
when	O
your	O
blood	O
pressure	O
was	O
low	O
so	O
we	O
gave	O
you	O
some	O
fluids	O
and	O
held	O
some	O
of	O
your	O
blood	O
pressure	O
medicines	O
while	O
you	O
were	O
here	O
and	O
your	O
blood	O
pressure	O
improved	O
and	O
your	O
symptoms	O
improved.	O
You	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
signs	O
of	O
having	O
had	O
a	O
stroke,	O
or	O
having	O
infections	O
when	O
we	O
examined	O
you,	O
tested	O
your	O
urine	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
your	O
chest	O
xray.	O
The	O
cause	O
of	O
your	O
dehydration	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
lots	O
of	O
sugar	O
in	O
your	O
urine,	O
which	O
can	O
cause	O
you	O
to	O
loose	O
more	O
water	O
than	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
in.	O
We	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
carotid	O
doppler	O
ultrasound	O
(ultrasound	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
vessels	O
in	O
your	O
neck)	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
due	O
to	O
some	O
blockage	O
of	O
these	O
arteries.	O
You	O
will	O
be	O
given	O
the	O

when	O
you	O

home,	O
your	O
primary	O

should	O
help	O
follow	O
up	O
these	O
studies.	O
During	O
your	O
hospital	O
stay	O
we	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
you	O

a	O
low	O
white	O
blood	O
cell	O
count	O
which	O
you	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
past.	O
You	O
had	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
any	O
infections.	O
This	O
should	O
be	O
followed-up	O
by	O
a	O
blood	O
count	O
draw	O
by	O
your	O
primary	O
